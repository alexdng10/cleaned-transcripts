00:01 the lesson on the emergence of global
00:03 

00:03 governance. As you can tell, we're going
00:06 

00:06 to be going through a lot of information
00:07 

00:07 in preparation for a very special guest,
00:10 

00:10 Dr. Walter Dorne.
00:16 

00:16 In my last lecture, I suggested that
00:18 

00:18 Canada should place armed troops along
00:20 

00:20 the longest undefended border in the
00:23 

00:23 world, and that would arguably slash a
00:26 

00:26 psychological wound between Canada and
00:28 

00:28 the United States. In our last lecture,
00:31 

00:31 I suggested a made in Canada
00:33 

00:33 peacekeeping operation.
00:35 

00:35 Of course, if we think back to the
00:38 

00:38 emergence of CO shut the Canada US
00:41 

00:41 border down completely, but it was the
00:44 

00:44 speed with which leaders of historically
00:47 

00:47 friendly countries agreed
00:49 

00:49 very speedily to go their separate ways
00:51 

00:51 that left indelible scars.
00:55 

00:55 Now, President Trump's threats to annex
00:58 

00:58 Canada as the 51st US state and to
01:02 

01:02 impose 25% trade tariffs are undermining
01:07 

01:07 the trust between Canadians and
01:09 

01:09 Americans and leading many Canadians to
01:12 

01:12 buy Canadian and Americans to actually
01:15 

01:15 buy Canadian, too. We're hearing that
01:17 

01:17 many Canadian goods, including the Arva
01:19 

01:19 Mills in London, Ontario, are being
01:21 

01:21 inundated with requests to buy Canadian.
01:26 

01:26 What will happen next?
01:30 

01:30 Under the pressure of a tiny virus, our
01:33 

01:33 paths diverged and our common US border
01:37 

01:37 widened. But the announcements by
01:39 

01:39 President Trump since the inauguration
01:42 

01:42 on January 20th, 2025 are creating more
01:46 

01:46 division, more division rather than
01:49 

01:49 unity. And as our economies become more
01:52 

01:52 strained and our health care systems are
01:55 

01:55 tested on both sides, the world cannot
01:58 

01:58 help but bear witness to growing
02:01 

02:01 divisions. There is fear about President
02:04 

02:04 Trump's suggestion to move all
02:07 

02:07 Palestinians, 2.1 million Palestinians,
02:10 

02:10 out of their ancestral grounds, out of
02:13 

02:13 the Gaza Strip to ready it for a US
02:16 

02:16 takeover. First, the Israelis uh might
02:20 

02:20 completely cleanse or ethnic cleanse. We
02:23 

02:23 don't know. Despite centuries of living
02:25 

02:25 in Palestine, the threat is there. So
02:28 

02:28 this lecture discusses global governance
02:31 

02:31 and the United Nations in the wake of
02:34 

02:34 the COVID pandemic, the Russian invasion
02:38 

02:38 of Ukraine sovereignty, and now American
02:41 

02:41 threats to take over Canada, Greenland,
02:45 

02:45 the Panama Canal, the Gaza Strip, and
02:49 

02:49 rename the Gulf of Mexico, which is
02:51 

02:51 already being done in American maps. So
02:54 

02:54 it's the Gulf of America. This lecture
02:57 

02:57 also takes place in the context of
02:59 

02:59 deportations.
03:04 

03:04 According to world meter uh which is uh
03:08 

03:08 a URL I put at the bottom there in the
03:10 

03:10 extra notes more than 1 million people
03:14 

03:14 exactly 1,90,82
03:17 

03:17 people in the United States succumb to
03:20 

03:20 the co virus as of October 2022. So more
03:24 

03:24 than a million people. Canada lost
03:27 

03:27 45,689
03:30 

03:30 people. That is a much less fewer
03:33 

03:33 people. Fewer people and a smaller rate
03:36 

03:36 of 843 people per million population. So
03:41 

03:41 Canada's health system and Canada's
03:44 

03:44 rigorous standards to close borders and
03:47 

03:47 to close cities and to close
03:49 

03:49 institutions like this university meant
03:52 

03:52 that there was a much smaller rate of
03:54 

03:54 deaths.
03:56 

03:56 Public opinion in the United States was
03:59 

03:59 marked by negative ratings of the
04:01 

04:01 presidents and political divisions with
04:04 

04:04 few having confidence in President Trump
04:07 

04:07 or his successor President Biden during
04:10 

04:10 the pandemic. Curiously, Prime Minister
04:13 

04:13 Trudeau's popularity increased
04:15 

04:15 dramatically in the polls during the
04:17 

04:17 pandemic with almost 2thirds of
04:20 

04:20 Canadians approving of his handling of
04:23 

04:23 the virus. So that's quite a switch from
04:27 

04:27 during the pandemic when he was
04:28 

04:28 extremely popular to now when he has
04:31 

04:31 recently resigned and will not be
04:33 

04:33 running for the role of prime minister
04:36 

04:36 after 9 years of being prime minister.
04:41 

04:41 when we uh look back liberal
04:44 

04:44 internationalism
04:45 

04:45 and an evidence-based feminist approach
04:48 

04:48 when we look back at that um it was
04:51 

04:51 marked by cooperation and level-headed
04:54 

04:54 thinking and it it's not just in Canada
04:58 

04:58 um that approach the feminist approach
04:60 

04:60 is still being followed in Ottawa at
05:02 

05:02 Global Affairs Canada and they insist
05:05 

05:05 that they are still taking a feminist
05:07 

05:07 approach.
05:09 

05:09 However, uh then Prime Minister Trudeau
05:11 

05:11 resigned under a cloud of being seen as
05:14 

05:14 anti-feminist doing to due to his
05:16 

05:16 finance minister Christia Freeland's
05:19 

05:19 abrupt surprising resignation. Christia
05:22 

05:22 Freeland ran for the leadership against
05:25 

05:25 Mark Carney, a new person, bank uh
05:28 

05:28 governor, etc. and against uh other
05:32 

05:32 people like uh Karina Gold. Freeland ran
05:35 

05:35 for the leadership but lost and the
05:37 

05:37 conservative leader Pierre Polyv who was
05:40 

05:40 expected to become the prime minister
05:42 

05:42 lost the election including his own seat
05:45 

05:45 leading to Carney's um minority
05:47 

05:47 government
05:52 

05:52 and I will explain. So Canada US
05:56 

05:56 relations are being judged in the wake
05:58 

05:58 in in the court really of of domestic
06:01 

06:01 and international public opinion. People
06:03 

06:03 are looking at the contrasting
06:05 

06:05 countries, how they handled CO and how
06:08 

06:08 they're going to handle tariffs and how
06:11 

06:11 are they going to handle the new
06:12 

06:12 administration with all the
06:14 

06:14 announcements that are happening in such
06:16 

06:16 a short time. when he was first
06:19 

06:19 president in February 2021, Donald Trump
06:22 

06:22 first proposed slashing 21% of foreign
06:25 

06:25 aid. In February, now in 2025, he has
06:29 

06:29 cut all of it and he's he's trying to
06:34 

06:34 fire all of the employees, the federal
06:36 

06:36 employees that work for US A. However, a
06:39 

06:39 judge has has has stymied that for now
06:42 

06:42 until next week. Okay. So, what did
06:45 

06:45 Canada do in contrast? In Canada, Canada
06:48 

06:48 very quietly, quiet diplomacy announced
06:51 

06:51 nearly 60 million, 159.5 million in
06:55 

06:55 humanitarian aid to a plethora of worthy
06:58 

06:58 organizations, many organizations
07:00 

07:00 including the Red Cross and UNICEF and
07:04 

07:04 Gabby, the vaccine alliance. So, uh,
07:08 

07:08 they they really tried to support
07:11 

07:11 humanitarian aid. And so, the question
07:12 

07:12 is, will Canada step up and try to spend
07:15 

07:15 more on humanitarian aid?
07:20 

07:20 In the midst of the pandemic, um,
07:22 

07:22 President Trump withheld more than US400
07:26 

07:26 million from the World Health
07:28 

07:28 Organization, the WHO. In fact, now he
07:31 

07:31 he is claiming that he before he claimed
07:33 

07:33 it had a Chinese bias. Now he's claiming
07:36 

07:36 just shut it down. So he has actually
07:39 

07:39 completely withdrawn the United States
07:41 

07:41 or he's trying to from the World Health
07:43 

07:43 Organization. On the other hand, Canada
07:46 

07:46 paid our dues and then voluntarily
07:49 

07:49 increased our contribution by millions.
07:51 

07:51 Now we can't make up for the the cuts of
07:54 

07:54 the United States. We certainly cannot.
07:57 

07:57 But it is interesting to contrast the
07:59 

07:59 two different approaches to global
08:02 

08:02 governance to international
08:03 

08:03 institutions.
08:06 

08:06 When we talk about international
08:08 

08:08 institutions, it was interesting that
08:10 

08:10 during the pandemic, uh, President
08:13 

08:13 Trump, uh, threatened to ban the export
08:16 

08:16 of personal protective equipment like
08:18 

08:18 gloves and masks and so on, including to
08:23 

08:23 us, the neighboring Canada. So, he was
08:25 

08:25 threatening then to stop exports.
08:30 

08:30 um we forget about all those threats
08:32 

08:32 back then and we went through all those
08:34 

08:34 threats before and so now the I want to
08:37 

08:37 draw your attention to Karina Gold. At
08:40 

08:40 that time the minister of international
08:42 

08:42 development was Karina Gold pictured
08:44 

08:44 here and she stepped up greatly to help
08:48 

08:48 convene the international group of
08:50 

08:50 friends on food and nutrition security.
08:53 

08:53 I remember at the time thinking, who is
08:55 

08:55 this very very young member of
08:57 

08:57 parliament who's confronting all the all
09:00 

09:00 of this and standing up in the House of
09:03 

09:03 Commons and saying, well, we're going to
09:04 

09:04 we're going to spend more to alleviate a
09:08 

09:08 hunger pandemic.
09:13 

09:13 Liberal leadership hopeful uh very young
09:16 

09:16 at that time, 37 years old. So she was
09:19 

09:19 the youngest candidate running against
09:21 

09:21 the contenders including the Bank of Cav
09:23 

09:23 Canada Canada Governor Mark Carney, the
09:25 

09:25 former finance minister and deputy prime
09:27 

09:27 minister Christia Freeland and then
09:30 

09:30 different MPs from uh all across Canada.
09:34 

09:34 So I just want to mention that as a
09:35 

09:35 leadership hopeful and the youngest
09:37 

09:37 contender she wanted to cut the federal
09:39 

09:39 sales tax and she also wanted to uh
09:42 

09:42 lower the GST for 4%. She was not able
09:45 

09:45 to raise the money uh to run for the
09:48 

09:48 leadership race and Freeland lost uh to
09:51 

09:51 Mark Carney.
09:57 

09:57 The province of Ontario and Canada also
09:59 

09:59 held an election one year early and they
10:02 

10:02 elected Douglas Ford in a majority win.
10:04 

10:04 So all these municipal, federal and
10:06 

10:06 provincial elections are a good
10:07 

10:07 opportunity for you to proctor or what
10:09 

10:09 we say invigilate elections and that can
10:12 

10:12 ready you to help proctor a foreign
10:13 

10:13 election perhaps for the United Nations.
10:16 

10:16 Perhaps most indicative of of America's
10:18 

10:18 growing isolationism and Canada's
10:20 

10:20 increasing solidarity in the community
10:23 

10:23 of nations was a proposal at the UN
10:25 

10:25 Security Council proposing a ceasefire
10:28 

10:28 for all nations to stop armed conflict
10:31 

10:31 and all fighting while humanity faced
10:34 

10:34 the common threat of COVID 19. It was an
10:37 

10:37 international call for common sense in
10:40 

10:40 which the United States was the lone
10:42 

10:42 voice of opposition by blocking the
10:44 

10:44 vote. The United States vetoed this
10:47 

10:47 ceasefire proposal during the pandemic.
10:53 

10:53 Co remains a global threat. And the most
10:57 

10:57 recent revelation tweeted, so we don't
10:59 

10:59 know if it's reliable at all, by Elon
11:01 

11:01 Musk, the world's richest person, was
11:04 

11:04 that the United States was intentionally
11:06 

11:06 funding research into COVID at the Wuhan
11:09 

11:09 lab in in China. I look confused because
11:13 

11:13 why would the United States be be
11:16 

11:16 funding research at the Wu at the Wuhan
11:18 

11:18 lab for China against China?
11:23 

11:23 But it might be that he's just confused
11:25 

11:25 because the CIA announced just just in
11:28 

11:28 the last few days that the Wuhan lab
11:30 

11:30 leak theory was the most likely source
11:32 

11:32 for CO. So what does this mean? The CIA
11:35 

11:35 is reporting that it was likely not a
11:38 

11:38 natural virus from a a black market from
11:42 

11:42 some sort of animal, but it was a
11:44 

11:44 Chinese-made virus in a military lab in
11:47 

11:47 a secondary military lab that escaped
11:50 

11:50 due to poor laboratory protocol. I
11:52 

11:52 remember that I followed this very
11:54 

11:54 closely and sent out a lot of
11:56 

11:56 information and newspaper magazine
11:58 

11:58 articles and everything to the
11:60 

11:60 international pugwash movement. Um,
12:03 

12:03 somebody wrote to me that that was
12:05 

12:05 racist to say that. But why would that
12:07 

12:07 be racist to say that it was a a leak
12:10 

12:10 from a military lab? So, people pounced
12:13 

12:13 on that said, you can't you can't argue
12:15 

12:15 that because that will start conflict
12:17 

12:17 with China. China doesn't wouldn't admit
12:19 

12:19 to anything. But, I mean, the fact of
12:21 

12:21 the matter is is that the Chinese didn't
12:24 

12:24 use a proper uh protocol. Neither do the
12:27 

12:27 Americans or the Russians. So this is
12:29 

12:29 inevitable that some sort of virus will
12:31 

12:31 continue to go around the world.
12:35 

12:35 Okay. What's our path forward for health
12:37 

12:37 and well-being and a virus-free world
12:40 

12:40 which I hope will happen is linked to
12:42 

12:42 many of the other global challenges that
12:44 

12:44 we face such as poverty, food
12:46 

12:46 insecurity, human sec insecurity and
12:49 

12:49 climate change. So none of these global
12:51 

12:51 problems can be tackled alone. No
12:53 

12:53 country can solve them. No person can
12:55 

12:55 solve them.
12:58 

12:58 no god can solve them. Um it it it we
13:01 

13:01 need a a united path forward. And this
13:04 

13:04 has been eloquently laid out
13:08 

13:08 by the UN in what's called agenda 2030,
13:11 

13:11 the year 2030. Um but most people refer
13:13 

13:13 to it as the sustainable development
13:16 

13:16 goals. You can see I'm wearing the
13:17 

13:17 sustainable development goal brooch
13:19 

13:19 today. Uh you can buy scarves, you can
13:22 

13:22 buy all sorts of things symbolizing your
13:25 

13:25 commitment to the uh STGS. So, there's
13:28 

13:28 17 SGS and I'm going to put a bigger
13:31 

13:31 picture of them.
13:34 

13:34 Here they are. Unfortunately, it means
13:36 

13:36 that you can't see that little corner,
13:37 

13:37 but that's okay. I think um so what I
13:40 

13:40 want to just draw your attention. So,
13:41 

13:41 these are visionary goals. They're not
13:43 

13:43 going to happen in our lifetime or your
13:45 

13:45 lifetime or your grandchildren's
13:47 

13:47 lifetime. They're not going to happen by
13:48 

13:48 2030. but they're a vision of peace of
13:52 

13:52 of how we can live as a humankind
13:56 

13:56 together peacefully on planet Earth. And
13:59 

13:59 so it's a vision to work toward. It's
14:02 

14:02 not going to happen. Um so people always
14:04 

14:04 say, "Oh well, see there's the
14:05 

14:05 sustainable development goals, the
14:07 

14:07 colors, which I'm wearing right here.
14:09 

14:09 Where are they?"
14:11 

14:11 Here. You'll see a lot of people from
14:14 

14:14 the UN wear them too. Like just and then
14:16 

14:16 we know we agree on those goals. So,
14:18 

14:18 we're trying to work toward those goals.
14:20 

14:20 Clean water for the world for the Gaza
14:23 

14:23 Strip. 90 There is no clean water in the
14:25 

14:25 Gaza Strip at all. No poverty,
14:29 

14:29 decent work, economic growth that is uh
14:32 

14:32 sustainable.
14:35 

14:35 Climate action is number 13. Uh
14:38 

14:38 preserving the the world's oceans.
14:40 

14:40 And what I'm talking about today is
14:42 

14:42 strong institutions, global governance,
14:44 

14:44 and the emergence of international
14:46 

14:46 institutions.
14:50 

14:50 The Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez
14:53 

14:53 of the United Nations has appealed for
14:56 

14:56 accelerated change in the coming decade
14:58 

14:58 of action toward 2030. And it's a common
15:02 

15:02 path forward which desperately needs
15:04 

15:04 world leaders whose vocabulary champions
15:06 

15:06 the words together, solidarity versus
15:09 

15:09 me, first them, us and so on. The kind
15:14 

15:14 of words of division. So Canada
15:17 

15:17 champions the STGS. Canada's officially
15:19 

15:19 in favor of the STGS and indeed this
15:21 

15:21 university is the top university I think
15:24 

15:24 in the world now but in Canada and our
15:27 

15:27 president he has an office over there
15:30 

15:30 has actually been the number one
15:32 

15:32 president in in favor of the sustainable
15:34 

15:34 development goals. I'm very very proud
15:36 

15:36 of our university. That's why you see
15:38 

15:38 all the posters everywhere and so on.
15:40 

15:40 Really we need to stand up and be proud
15:42 

15:42 about this.
15:45 

15:45 Okay, so Canadians, we have mantras that
15:48 

15:48 have become the proved working language
15:50 

15:50 of the federal government pictured here.
15:52 

15:52 I used to live right where that Canadian
15:54 

15:54 flag is and I used to look out at the uh
15:57 

15:57 Parliament Hill, walk my dogs on the
15:60 

15:60 that's the it's the Gno uh Udway side,
16:02 

16:02 the the hull side. Uh so anyway, the
16:05 

16:05 working language, the mantras is of the
16:08 

16:08 sustainable development goals. Until you
16:10 

16:10 go to the United Nations and until you
16:11 

16:11 go to Ottawa, you don't realize how
16:13 

16:13 embedded this STGS are in their way of
16:17 

16:17 thinking.
16:20 

16:20 Okay. To end here this lecture, a
16:23 

16:23 digital movement map of Canadian
16:25 

16:25 organizations, NOS's and so on
16:27 

16:27 identifies almost 12,000 civil society
16:30 

16:30 groups that work on the SGS. 12,000
16:34 

16:34 different organizations in Canada that
16:37 

16:37 are working toward a resilient common
16:39 

16:39 future. That's an astounding number of
16:42 

16:42 people who are volunteering to work
16:45 

16:45 toward this vision. Uh so I do have a
16:48 

16:48 supplementary lecture in the
16:49

16:51 

16:51 take a look at it on voluntary
16:53
