lesson 6B welcome to lesson 6B Global
0:03
governance
0:06
today nowhere is leadership needed more
0:09
than at the United Nations not just at
0:12
the UN General Assembly which is a talk
0:14
shop for Resolutions as we learned last
0:16
week but rather at the UN Security
0:19
Council pictured here that's where
0:21
Global Security concerns are hotly
0:23
debated and a Gaza takeover would
0:25
violate international law according to
0:28
experts not just according to
0:32
president Trump has declared that the
0:34
United States should take over the Gaza
0:36
Strip permanently transfer its entire
0:39
2.1 million population 2.1 million
0:43
people to Egypt and Jordan which are the
0:45
neighboring countries and redevelop it
0:48
into the what he calls the Riviera of
0:50
the Middle East Riviera refers to kind
0:53
of a resort along a river that with
0:57
hotels presumably that proposal which
0:59
Trump and unveiled during a press
1:01
conference with prime minister Benjamin
1:03
netu of Israel we often call him for
1:06
short nanu or BB some people call him
1:09
his nickname BB the longest serving
1:11
prime minister of Israel pictured
1:15
here so uh uh TR uh president Trump andu
1:20
would this would this agreement would
1:22
unquestionably be a severe violation of
1:24
international law it looks like they
1:26
agreed that uh uh BB was not taken by
1:29
surprise that because they're already
1:32
ordering um uh Israeli soldiers to clear
1:35
the land and and uh it looks like
1:39
forcefully um push people out but we're
1:41
not sure yet so we're not
1:45
sure forc deportation when you forcibly
1:48
Deport not uh attract people to to
1:52
immigration um or the transfer of a
1:56
civilian population somehow is a
1:58
violation of international humanitarian
2:00
law it's a war crime and it is a crime
2:03
against humanity so the international
2:06
prohibition against forced deportations
2:08
of civilians has been a part of the law
2:10
of War since the lever code which was a
2:13
set of rules on the conduct of
2:14
hostilities that was first promulgated
2:16
by Union forces during the US Civil War
2:20
I put a picture here of all these people
2:23
diplomats signing uh after the World War
2:26
II the um the Geneva conventions and
2:31
after the nurburg trial so these uh this
2:35
these Norms have been in place since
2:37
World War II and actually arguably
2:39
before
2:41
that the Rome statute of the
2:44
international criminal court lists
2:46
forcible population transfers as both a
2:48
war crime and a crime against humanity
2:51
and if the displacement is focused as it
2:55
is here on a particular group based on
2:57
their ethnic religious or national
2:59
identity
3:00
then it is also uh called persecution
3:03
which is an additional crime now
3:05
Palestine as we spoke about is an
3:08
observer to the uh to the United Nations
3:11
General Assembly uh the court it it's a
3:14
actual party to the international
3:16
criminal court so that court has
3:18
jurisdiction over those crimes if they
3:20
take place within Gaza even if they are
3:23
committed by citizens of the United
3:25
States which is not a member of the
3:28
court so the United States is not a
3:30
member of the international Court
3:32
pictured here which is an organ of the
3:34
United Nations um and it's it's situated
3:37
in the ha in
3:40
Europe when Trump was asked how much of
3:43
that gaza's population he wanted to move
3:46
he said all of them adding I would think
3:49
they would be thrilled and when he was
3:51
pressed by a journalist on whether he
3:53
would force them to go even if they uh
3:56
did not want to Trump said I don't think
3:59
they're going to tell me no I'm sure
4:00
most of you saw that press conference I
4:03
know a lot of my students have written
4:04
to me and students that I had last year
4:07
or two years ago from third year I
4:09
wanted to mention you can still email me
4:11
and communicate with me once you
4:13
graduate I'm always happy to hear from
4:14
you and Professor Simpson me reminds all
4:17
of you that this forcible uh deportation
4:21
would be a straightforward War crime to
4:24
Advocate this scale of coercion and
4:26
forced removal would make this a crime
4:28
against human
4:33
Humanity the United Nations recognized
4:35
Palestine as a permanent Observer State
4:38
it's not a a recognized State party and
4:42
146 out of 193 UN member states
4:45
recognize Palestinian stat Palestine as
4:48
a as a state but the United States does
4:51
not recognize it the prohibition on one
4:54
state annexing all or part of another
4:57
State's territory is one of the most
5:00
it's really one of the most foundational
5:02
principles of the West Vilan era it and
5:05
it's a principle not just of
5:06
international law but when Russia
5:09
invaded Ukraine everyone in the world
5:12
recognized that that was that was um an
5:14
annexation that could not be abided
5:17
States and you can quote me cannot
5:20
conquer someone else's territory if a
5:22
state violates that rule as in the case
5:25
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the
5:27
response must be wide spread
5:30
condemnation aggression which the
5:32
international ICC the international
5:34
criminal court defines as a state using
5:37
Force against the sovereignty
5:39
territorial Integrity or political
5:41
independence of another state in any or
5:44
in any other manner inconsistent with
5:45
the charter of the United Nations is
5:47
also a crime so I'm talking about crimes
5:51
here president Trump continues to seem
5:55
unconcerned with how his proposal might
5:57
be viewed by the global institutions
6:00
that underpin the international legal
6:03
system and so we're talking with a a a
6:06
famous a peacekeeper um this week uh Dr
6:10
Walter Dorne on uh International
6:13
institutions and I'm sure that he'll
6:14
have a lot to say about President
6:17
Trump's unconcern lack of concern for
6:20
international institutions for the
6:22
United States participating in those
6:24
International institutions and we're
6:26
seeing a flurry of announcements from
6:28
president Trump on February 5 th 2025 he
6:31
signed an executive order calling for a
6:34
general review of us funding and
6:37
involvement in the United Nations and
6:39
that raises questions about the United
6:41
States commitment to a global
6:45
institution the newly inaugurated
6:47
President also has already withdrawn the
6:49
United States from the UN Human Rights
6:51
Council Trump is uh casually making
6:55
policy proposals that propos to violate
6:57
the absolute bedrock principes
7:00
of international law so we talked before
7:03
about Russia in the uh Security Council
7:06
and we talked about the violation when I
7:08
lectured with you and also um we will be
7:11
talking more about uh not just Kosovo
7:14
but and not just Afghanistan but we'll
7:16
also be talking about Ukraine uh but
7:19
let's move
7:21
on and ask whether the UN Security
7:24
Council will take action we know that
7:26
leaders like the Saudi Crown Prince m
7:29
Muhammad B Solomon pictured here look
7:32
how young he is condemn Israel's actions
7:35
in Gaza as genocide he has already come
7:38
out very strongly and said that this
7:40
action of of possibly taking over the
7:43
Gaza Strip for the United States um is
7:46
is is
7:47
intolerable um in
7:50
2020 Canada competed with Norway and
7:53
Ireland for a seat for elected seat on
7:57
the rotating un Security Council now
7:59
I've talked to you about the security
8:01
Council could Canada take action on the
8:03
security Council right now Norway and
8:06
Ireland are on it they're are both
8:07
generous donors when it comes to
8:09
International Aid so they will they
8:12
already beat out Canada easily despite
8:14
last minute
8:15
Lobby by the Canadian delegation I've
8:18
showed you the picture of the un uh here
8:22
the United Nations security Council
8:25
location which is in the United States
8:28
so we're going to see what happens cuz
8:29
will the United Nations even maybe move
8:31
out of um uh could it move to Canada
8:34
that would be interesting uh the former
8:36
liberal prime minister Lester Pearson
8:38
originally set the greed upon standard
8:40
of
8:41
0.7% of gross national product uh to to
8:45
be spent on on development that's what
8:49
nations should aspire to now he was one
8:51
of What's called the three wise men and
8:53
when he proposed that back in the in the
8:57
1970s uh that was a bar that nations
9:00
were supposed to Aspire to now the only
9:02
countries that have have actually
9:04
reached it are the Scandinavian
9:05
countries including Norway and Denmark
9:08
which are exceeding it and Ireland is
9:10
far far ahead of
9:13
Canada president Trump has cut all the
9:16
US Aid and that affects hundreds of Aid
9:19
organizations around the world right now
9:22
millions of people who rely on us Aid to
9:25
survive for all types of things are are
9:28
being prevented from obtaining that Aid
9:31
so that's I've I've juxtaposed that
9:33
these two uh men here president Trump
9:36
looking triumphant and Lester B peon one
9:39
of the wise men called by the
9:41
International Community one of the wise
9:42
men uh looking quite
9:47
sad okay so I mentioned Canada's
9:49
feminist International approach
9:51
intersectionalist approach uh you can
9:54
they call it a feminist approach but
9:56
despite the it's duly laed people always
9:59
talk about how how wonderful it is and
10:01
so on our measure of International
10:03
Development is still and has been for
10:06
decades lagging it's approximately it's
10:09
less than 1% of our G gross national
10:12
income it is approximately
10:14
0.28% even though Karina gold was the
10:17
minister of International Development
10:19
she was not able to bring it up um to
10:21
higher than that's really low
10:26
0.28% okay so Canadian share a Global
10:29
identity marked by International
10:31
cooperation by the ideas multilateralism
10:34
by concrete actions that cherish global
10:36
citizenship and you're in um my class
10:39
here learning about Canada abroad I also
10:41
teach Global diplomacy and I teach a
10:43
class called Global uh violence Global
10:48
violence okay so in those classes I did
10:51
not cover this but I just want to cover
10:53
this for a minute about the official
10:54
secret vote uh among un ambassadors
10:57
which took place in June 2020 and I
10:59
happened to be at New York City Canada
11:01
lost terribly we could not gain ground
11:03
the the UN General Assembly countries
11:05
just simply just did not vote for Canada
11:07
at all the Canadians thought they were
11:09
going to get win you know I was talking
11:11
to them oh yeah we're going to we're
11:12
going to come back we're going to get in
11:13
there no way know how so the media
11:17
tended to contrast Canada's values with
11:20
the current American leadership back
11:22
then and it was clear there was this
11:24
Divergent which which was quite notable
11:26
and will probably maybe become more
11:28
notable now we'll see
11:32
in 2020 it proved not to be the time for
11:34
Canada to be to become a member of the
11:36
rotating un Security Council be even
11:38
though we had a feminist International
11:40
Leadership and a caring International
11:42
reputation we were not able to sit
11:45
across the table from the United States
11:47
China and Russia from the P5 powers and
11:50
speak up strongly for a better world a
11:52
world that is surely listening now so
11:54
will Canada serve on the UN Security
11:56
Council soon I do not think so because
11:59
the recent contributions to peacekeeping
12:02
are so low and Dr Walter Dorne for sure
12:04
will talk about those low contributions
12:06
because he's been one of the foremost
12:08
critics uh in Canada and the world of uh
12:11
Canada's peacekeeping
12:15
contribution Trudeau uh prime minister
12:17
Trudeau pictured in the House of Commons
12:19
on June 18th 2020 said the liberal
12:22
government knew Canada was behind its
12:24
competitors when it announced its
12:26
intention to run for a seat but it was
12:28
hoping it could make up the difference
12:29
during the campaign this sounds like the
12:31
same refrain all the time I was there
12:34
during their $50 million campaign I
12:35
didn't take any money but I was there
12:37
for a different reason and Canada was
12:39
too late it was clear our peacekeeping
12:41
reputation was seen as poor by many many
12:44
countries in the UN General Assembly and
12:46
and Dr Dorne will talk to you about that
12:48
I'm
12:50
sure so here we have a picture of uh
12:53
Walter Dorne he is a what I call a media
12:56
U person who goes on CTV CBC CBC radio
13:00
and he's always on television so once
13:02
you meet him uh he'll be lecturing in
13:05
our class for the remainder for a short
13:08
uh mini what I call Mini lecture he's a
13:10
professor at the Royal Military College
13:12
and at the Canadian Forces College it's
13:14
a officers Pro program and he's often
13:17
spoken to uh Canadians from uh hotspots
13:22
like uh Nepal and East Tour from um oh
13:28
Africa different countries that he's
13:30
been to so he'll talk to
13:31
us and my final slide here is here he is
13:35
I believe on CBC talking about the um
13:39
first year anniversary of Russia's
13:41
attack on Ukraine so Walter Dorne and I
13:44
are often on the media uh together or
13:47
separately or we refer each other and so
13:49
on and that really helps as well and I'm
13:51
really happy that he agreed even though
13:53
he's extremely busy now the only
13:55
stipulation he made is he definitely
13:57
wants students to be there that's going
13:58
to be difficult if I invite all of you
14:00
to come my zoom uh Zoom will only take I
14:04
also don't have any marks for
14:06
participation and I can't do that
14:07
because some of you can't participate
14:10
because you're in China Nepal or you're
14:12
in nursing and you have all day
14:14
practicians practicum so I can't give a
14:17
participation point but what I can
14:19
extend to you is if you do come and you
14:21
do ask a question then I will keep the
14:23
careful note and if and if I do end up
14:25
writing a reference letter for you then
14:27
that would be something that I would
14:28
definitely love you for because it's
14:30
very hard to ask a question of a guest
14:32
speaker and I'm very very aware of that
14:35
so I will be hosting him as soon as I
14:36
can pin him down and I look forward to
14:39
uh your reaction thanks for listening
