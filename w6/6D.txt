00:01 Okay, welcome to uh the 6D quiz and
00:04 

00:04 midterm exam information. I'm not using
00:06 

00:06 my face on the corner because there's
00:08 

00:08 always a lot of uh information that I
00:11 

00:11 want to include on each slide. This is
00:14 

00:14 my important advice about the quizzes
00:16 

00:16 and midterms. It's important to look on
00:18 

00:18 the calendar tab for the dates. If
00:21 

00:21 you're registered with accessible
00:23 

00:23 education, you will get an email
00:24 

00:24 confirmation that your extra time has
00:27 

00:27 been added. each student has a certain
00:30 

00:30 amount of extra time. It's it's
00:32 

00:32 expressed as a ratio. You will get that
00:35 

00:35 email confirmation that you are um with
00:38 

00:38 accessible education in that group. If
00:40 

00:40 you don't get it and you are with
00:42 

00:42 accessible education, then you need to
00:45 

00:45 email us. But the chance of that is very
00:47 

00:47 low.
00:50 

00:50 Where do you find out the quizzes and
00:52 

00:52 the exam times? look on your calendar
00:55 

00:55 tool which is on your tab. You don't
00:58 

00:58 look in the course regulations. You
01:01 

01:01 don't look in the course rules, the
01:04 

01:04 course overview because the uh times can
01:07 

01:07 change unexpectedly.
01:09 

01:09 We can't predict when exam central will
01:12 

01:12 schedule or reschedule an exam. And it
01:16 

01:16 it has happened to me that uh Owl
01:19 

01:19 collapsed uh once and we had to
01:22 

01:22 reschedule the whole exam. Not my fault
01:24 

01:24 but all collapsed because too many
01:26 

01:26 students tried to get online across
01:29 

01:29 campus.
01:31 

01:31 So the Senate Review Board SRBA which I
01:34 

01:34 served on for nine years or your
01:37 

01:37 academic counselor or the vice provost
01:39 

01:39 or dean reviews your appeal. That's why
01:42 

01:42 I don't put the dates inside the course
01:44 

01:44 regulations because then it's
01:46 

01:46 appealable. A course appeal is when you
01:48 

01:48 challenge a course regulation or
01:50 

01:50 decision. It's the regulations that are
01:52 

01:52 in those course regulations. I'll tell
01:54 

01:54 you right away, if you miss a quiz or
01:56 

01:56 exam, your counselor will not will fail
01:59 

01:59 your appeal because there's so many
02:01 

02:01 rules that they have everywhere. So, if
02:03 

02:03 you sleep in or you drive all night and
02:05 

02:05 you miss it, that's not grounds. you'll
02:08 

02:08 you'll actually lose that that 40% exam
02:10 

02:10 or 10% um quiz which is over 5 days.
02:15 

02:15 Okay. So, course regulations required a
02:18 

02:18 structured appeal process and the
02:20 

02:20 university's academic calendar. The
02:23 

02:23 calendar by the university is subject to
02:25 

02:25 an appeal. But anyway, to make a long
02:27 

02:27 story short, things can change abruptly
02:29 

02:29 but not the course regulations.
02:33 

02:33 Those are set in stone. Okay, surprise
02:36 

02:36 quiz. Uh we're going to just go through
02:38 

02:38 some questions here you haven't studied
02:41 

02:41 uh yet perhaps. And here's the question
02:44 

02:44 uh from the first uh uh sub lesson 1 a.
02:49 

02:49 And the answer here is which one of
02:51 

02:51 these questions is not useful to
02:53 

02:53 memorize
02:54 

02:54 which one. So you read it over um you
02:58 

02:58 eliminate the ones you read over the
03:01 

03:01 question. You eliminate the ones that
03:02 

03:02 are obviously not it. And you guess well
03:05 

03:05 it's E. Where were you born?
03:09 

03:09 Terrible question to ask anyone. Never,
03:11 

03:11 never, ever ask anyone where were you
03:13 

03:13 born. Not even a taxi driver. Never do
03:16 

03:16 that. It's really impolite and rude. Uh,
03:19 

03:19 so the right answer here is E. So the
03:22 

03:22 questions come at you. They're they're
03:24 

03:24 linear. You can't go back to question
03:27 

03:27 one. You have to keep going once you
03:30 

03:30 selected the answer. They're linear. So,
03:33 

03:33 you haven't taken the quiz. Here's
03:36 

03:36 another one. I always put the lesson
03:38 

03:38 that it's from at the beginning. And I
03:41 

03:41 think most of the questions just make
03:43 

03:43 common sense. The answers are really
03:45 

03:45 obvious. Here's one. I mean, you've
03:48 

03:48 heard the lecture once. Uh, so you can
03:51 

03:51 kind of think about it. So, here, this
03:53 

03:53 is key. according to professor Simpson
03:55 

03:55 because in your reality it might be a
03:56 

03:56 different answer but in the lecture
03:59 

03:59 according to my audio um what was what
04:02 

04:02 what is the recommended approach to
04:04 

04:04 making conversation uh so you read it
04:07 

04:07 over and you think about it and um you
04:12 

04:12 kind of try to remember what we were
04:14 

04:14 talking about so here I think that this
04:17 

04:17 is the right answer according to me
04:19 

04:19 according to that lecture obviously you
04:21 

04:21 might think it's more fun to talk about
04:23 

04:23 the Blue Jays, but the lecture said that
04:26 

04:26 it was to ask about their ideas.
04:31 

04:31 Okay. If you have problems with a
04:33 

04:33 question, you are not allowed to take
04:35 

04:35 any screenshots during an exam or a
04:37 

04:37 quiz. That's a university policy that
04:40 

04:40 I'm required to continually repeat. So,
04:43 

04:43 if you send me a screenshot, that is
04:45 

04:45 actually something that could get you
04:47 

04:47 sent up to the dean's office because
04:48 

04:48 it's an academic offense. you took a
04:51 

04:51 screenshot during a test or a quiz. Uh
04:54 

04:54 what you need to do is write out the
04:56 

04:56 problematic question. Students have
04:58 

04:58 taken pictures of themselves writing out
05:00 

05:00 the problematic question basically. Um
05:04 

05:04 or or like take writing the problematic
05:06 

05:06 question out handwriting. So I can't
05:08 

05:08 read what their handwriting is um here.
05:12 

05:12 Why would they be doing that? Because
05:13 

05:13 they don't know what the answer is and
05:16 

05:16 they think I didn't lecture on it. Now,
05:18 

05:18 what I always do is the picture always
05:20 

05:20 relates to that lecture slide. I'm not
05:22 

05:22 unfair. I don't put unrelated pictures
05:25 

05:25 in that would confuse you. So, this
05:27 

05:27 picture is exactly from that lecture
05:29 

05:29 slide to twig your memory. And then
05:32 

05:32 here, what's the major event here? You
05:34 

05:34 can read it over. And sometimes there's
05:37 

05:37 two answers that seem to be fairly
05:40 

05:40 correct, but the lecture said it was B.
05:45 

05:45 COVID 19 pandem pandemic.
05:49 

05:49 Okay. So here um another question I'm
05:53 

05:53 just generating questions right now. So
05:56 

05:56 this is a question that I'm trying to
05:58 

05:58 work on. Um so you can see I'm adding
05:60 

05:60 nonsensical stuff although it might seem
06:03 

06:03 to make sense. Um, and then I'm you have
06:06 

06:06 to read my answers pretty carefully. But
06:08 

06:08 if you've listened to the lecture once,
06:11 

06:11 uh, and you've seen the PowerPoint, then
06:14 

06:14 you know that it's B.
06:17 

06:17 The correct answer is B. Now, what you
06:20 

06:20 could do is just copy the whole question
06:22 

06:22 into chat into the free version, which I
06:25 

06:25 did to show you what's happening here.
06:27 

06:27 And chat is most of the time very, very
06:30 

06:30 correct. In fact, um it's amazing how
06:33 

06:33 correct that it is. But then sometimes
06:36 

06:36 it hallucinates because it wants to
06:38 

06:38 provide you always with a correct
06:39 

06:39 answer. So it will give an answer that
06:42 

06:42 it thinks is correct even though it's
06:44 

06:44 not. I'm I'm finding it interesting. Um
06:48 

06:48 so here we put in we into chat and chat
06:50 

06:50 says the correct answer is is the
06:52 

06:52 correct answer. That's the free version.
06:56 

06:56 Okay. So here I I've put the same
06:59 

06:59 question into Dr. Google using CtrlF.
07:03 

07:03 Now, it's hard to do that because I
07:04 

07:04 usually have pictures of the questions
07:06 

07:06 on the multiple choice. So, you're
07:08 

07:08 committing an academic offense. You're
07:10 

07:10 also having to retype the question uh
07:14 

07:14 because I've taken a picture of it. Not
07:16 

07:16 on all of them, but most of them that I
07:18 

07:18 think you might try to control F on and
07:20 

07:20 that's an academic offense. So, here I I
07:23 

07:23 put it into Google and of course um
07:26 

07:26 Google gave me some different URLs. So,
07:28 

07:28 I I got distracted and I'm spending more
07:30 

07:30 than two minutes on this question trying
07:33 

07:33 to figure it out when I could have just
07:35 

07:35 read it, thought about it, and realized
07:37 

07:37 that it's B.
07:41 

07:41 So, my warning once again is it is an
07:44 

07:44 academic scholastic offense and I insert
07:47 

07:47 images of the actual questions to
07:49 

07:49 prevent cheating. So, the question is
07:52 

07:52 photographed. If you attempt to use
07:54 

07:54 Google, you will be forced to retype the
07:56 

07:56 question manually. But I'm not really
07:58 

07:58 worried about Google at all. I'm worried
07:59 

07:59 about chat. And here what I want to
08:02 

08:02 mention to you is let's say you have not
08:04 

08:04 opened any of the lectures on all
08:08 

08:08 Brightpace and then you use chat to
08:10 

08:10 answer all the questions and you're at
08:13 

08:13 home alone and nobody can see you. this
08:16 

08:16 someday we will figure out how to how to
08:19 

08:19 catch you and that will be considered an
08:21 

08:21 academic offense and you will someday be
08:25 

08:25 caught. It might it'll probably not be
08:26 

08:26 on my exam because it's too early in the
08:28 

08:28 life of chat GBT but we have a committee
08:30 

08:30 and we're figuring out things and
08:32 

08:32 basically all I can tell you is you will
08:34 

08:34 be expelled from any university in
08:36 

08:36 Canada for cheating. If it's continual
08:39 

08:39 cheating the SRBA will expel you. And
08:43 

08:43 I've been on the SRBA and I've seen that
08:45 

08:45 happen. It's it's pretty upsetting.
08:47 

08:47 People end up having to leave Canada,
08:49 

08:49 their visa, one guy, remembered, had to
08:51 

08:51 go back to Saudi Arabia. His family lost
08:53 

08:53 all their money and he kept appealing
08:55 

08:55 trying it to get us to change our minds.
08:57 

08:57 And no, he didn't. Anyway, do not risk
08:60 

08:60 your academic future.
09:02 

09:02 Remember, I am not trying to trick you.
09:05 

09:05 My questions are not trying to trick
09:07 

09:07 you. Sometimes students will sit there
09:09 

09:09 and they'll go, "Oh, well, is she trying
09:10 

09:10 to trick me?" you know, maybe it's not
09:12 

09:12 that common sense answer and so on. No,
09:14 

09:14 just take your time. Read the question
09:16 

09:16 and answers a few times. Eliminate the
09:18 

09:18 answers that are obviously incorrect and
09:20 

09:20 choose the one that you think in your
09:22 

09:22 gut is the right answer.
09:24 

09:24 Now, I want to warn you to protect your
09:27 

09:27 notes. If you use um uh Quizlet or you
09:30 

09:30 use a um uh notes that you put online,
09:35 

09:35 other students may find them to be
09:36 

09:36 outdated or incorrect because I update
09:39 

09:39 my lectures every every uh term. A lot
09:42 

09:42 of the old notes that I look at on
09:44 

09:44 Quizlet are amazingly outdated. You
09:47 

09:47 know, they might talk about NAFTA or
09:49 

09:49 something like that. Once I emailed a
09:51 

09:51 student because her notes were so poor
09:53 

09:53 and so hastily written that they were
09:56 

09:56 misleading students. They were getting
09:58 

09:58 lower marks. I was sure of it. So I
09:59 

09:59 emailed her and it turned out she was
10:01 

10:01 hiking in Nepal and she didn't realize
10:03 

10:03 that Quizlet had saved her notes because
10:06 

10:06 that's its default. Quizlet takes all
10:08 

10:08 the notes and default saves them. So she
10:12 

10:12 actually was so upset. I remember she
10:14 

10:14 hiked for three days back to a Wi-Fi
10:17 

10:17 place and then as soon as she'd removed
10:19 

10:19 her note, she emailed me from wherever
10:21 

10:21 it was in Nepal. So, do not risk your
10:24 

10:24 notes being used by others to cheat and
10:26 

10:26 take responsibility for what you share
10:28 

10:28 online. The ones that are selling the
10:30 

10:30 notes with the questions, I just laugh
10:32 

10:32 because there's there's literally 5,000
10:34 

10:34 questions. So, how could you have gotten
10:36 

10:36 them? You don't have them.
10:38 

10:38 The quickest way to study is to listen
10:40 

10:40 to the lecture one time and then review
10:43 

10:43 the slides one time. You don't have to
10:44 

10:44 listen to the lecture again, but you
10:46 

10:46 should listen to it once. Um now my
10:49 

10:49 issue is of course all now the new all
10:52 

10:52 uh bright space you have to shorten all
10:54 

10:54 the lecture titles. I used to have in
10:56 

10:56 the question always have the lecture
10:58 

10:58 title but now they want only 50
11:01 

11:01 characters which means I have to rewrite
11:03 

11:03 everything. I'm not sure I'm going to
11:05 

11:05 have time to do that to rewrite the
11:07 

11:07 whole thing. But anyway here's a sample
11:09 

11:09 question from 1B uh 2135 on Canada's
11:15 

11:15 foreign policy liberal internationalism.
11:16 

11:16 I'm not obligated to put the whole
11:18 

11:18 lesson in. I can just put what the name
11:20 

11:20 was. What was the primary focus of
11:22 

11:22 Lester Bison's Temple University? Okay,
11:25 

11:25 so this is a bit of a harder challenging
11:27 

11:27 question. And so you just read all the
11:30 

11:30 answers
11:32 

11:32 and then I think on this point um I
11:36 

11:36 randomly p pushes the the answers are
11:39 

11:39 the questions are linear but the answers
11:41 

11:41 are also randomized. They're randomized.
11:44 

11:44 So what was correct before was C but now
11:48 

11:48 what is correct is A. So that means that
11:50 

11:50 if someone's writing beside you they
11:52 

11:52 they'd say A is correct. Well you don't
11:53 

11:53 know what A your A is different. Okay.
11:56 

11:56 Now your friends will receive different
11:58 

11:58 questions different answers and the
11:60 

11:60 question pool is very large. So it is
12:02 

12:02 unlikely you will receive the same
12:04 

12:04 question twice. It's an academic offense
12:06 

12:06 to ask your friend to write the exam
12:08 

12:08 again because they got a high score and
12:10 

12:10 you didn't study. That's an academic
12:12 

12:12 offense and your friend will also be
12:14 

12:14 expelled
12:16 

12:16 if if it is found out that you did that.
12:19 

12:19 So let's say your friend took the quiz
12:21 

12:21 three times and they took I mean they
12:23 

12:23 have literally at that point answered
12:25 

12:25 120 questions. The pools are not large
12:29 

12:29 enough um for you not to encounter the
12:32 

12:32 or him or her whoever it is that you
12:34 

12:34 bribe to do that. Um so it is really a
12:37 

12:37 bad idea. Um, you should really try and
12:40 

12:40 take the quiz three times because it
12:41 

12:41 really helps you to figure out the
12:44 

12:44 questions and answers and it helps you
12:45 

12:45 to study. It really helps you. That's
12:47 

12:47 what it's meant to do. It's meant to
12:48 

12:48 help you.
12:52 

12:52 Okay. PowerPoint SL slides are available
12:54 

12:54 including uh one set from the speaker
12:57 

12:57 Walter Dorne in lesson six. Let me
13:00 

13:00 mention that all Brightpace can monitor
13:02 

13:02 whether students have opened windows and
13:04 

13:04 when. uh WTS technicians and I can see
13:08 

13:08 if you've opened the course site and at
13:10 

13:10 what time and what date. Many students
13:13 

13:13 have not opened the course yet. Only a
13:15 

13:15 few are asking about course regulations
13:17 

13:17 like where is the quiz or the exam date
13:19 

13:19 in the course regulations. The um answer
13:22 

13:22 of course is in the course calendar and
13:24 

13:24 the chatbot also tells you uh the dates.
13:29 

13:29 Let me mention that I'm not going to be
13:31 

13:31 using that. I don't if there's an extra
13:33 

13:33 supplementary video I've done on my
13:35 

13:35 reasoning for that.
13:42 

13:42 Following the call for the creation of
13:44 

13:44 UN peacekeeping force for Rwanda, no
13:46 

13:46 countries. So the answer would be zero.
13:50 

13:50 Um a lot of the questions uh are easily
13:53 

13:53 you can work your way through it if you
13:55 

13:55 listen to the lecture one time at high
13:57 

13:57 speed or if you've listened to it a
13:59 

13:59 couple of times.
14:01 

14:01 I think that it the exam is very easy.
14:06 

14:06 My best advice is to think it through.
14:07 

14:07 You do not need to study every word and
14:09 

14:09 concept that we explain.
14:12 

14:12 Relax and use your very powerful brain
14:14 

14:14 to figure out the right answers. Your
14:16 

14:16 best ally is your mind and not your
14:17 

14:17 notes. Don't use you're not allowed to
14:20 

14:20 use another screen. You're not allowed
14:21 

14:21 to go to another adi device like your
14:23 

14:23 phone to use Google or chat. Your best
14:26 

14:26 ally is your own very intelligent brain.
14:28 

14:28 So, good luck.
14:31 

14:31 I've given you another example here to
14:33 

14:33 think it through. I I really think this
14:35 

14:35 is a very easy question. You do not need
14:37 

14:37 to study every word and concept that I
14:39 

14:39 explained to figure out that the right
14:40 

14:40 answer is C. Let me uh show that
14:44 

14:44 picture. That student would be
14:45 

14:45 committing a scholastic offense in my
14:47 

14:47 class. That's because they're consulting
14:49 

14:49 another screen and their notes. If you
14:52 

14:52 consult another screen during the
14:54 

14:54 midterm or the final exam, you have
14:56 

14:56 committed a schoolastic offense and it
14:57 

14:57 will rest on your conscience.
15:01 

15:01 Let me finally add that I have many uh
15:03 

15:03 supplementary lectures. I've recently
15:05 

15:05 added one on the UN uh one on uh all
15:08 

15:08 bright space and its limitations uh the
15:10 

15:10 problems with how it's measuring. It
15:12 

15:12 does not accurately measure time spent
15:14 

15:14 on lectures or the use of library tools.
15:16 

15:16 I added one on how to travel the world
15:18 

15:18 with Dr. Britain. In short, those
15:20 

15:20 supplementary lectures are there for
15:22 

15:22 your interest and your enrichment, but
15:24 

15:24 they are not on the exam. I am not a
15:26 

15:26 medical professional. Uh there are also
15:28 

15:28 lectures on how to overcome anxiety,
15:30 

15:30 fear, how to overcome fear of public
15:32 

15:32 speaking, perfectionism, but these are
15:35 

15:35 suggestions only and are not examinable.
15:43 

15:43 Finally, um try to quell your brain's
15:45 

15:45 anxiety by putting anxiety into a
15:47 

15:47 relaxing chair based on the movie. Put a
15:50 

15:50 list on your fridge or in your pocket of
15:52 

15:52 your favorite activities and call this
15:54 

15:54 your extreme self-care list. every day
15:57 

15:57 do at least one thing on your list uh in
15:59 

15:59 order to deal with the inevitable
16:01 

16:01 anxiety um that that is experienced by
16:04 

16:04 everyone.
16:05 

16:05 Thank you for listening.
