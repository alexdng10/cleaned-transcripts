00:07 

00:07 a wonderful professor at the Canadian
00:09 

00:09 Forces college and at the Royal Military
00:11 

00:11 College as I mentioned in my lecture he
00:14 

00:14 has appeared very often on CTV CBC you
00:18 

00:18 may have seen him or heard him on CBC
00:20

00:23 

00:23 Peacekeeper and also he has a PhD from
00:26 

00:26 the University of Toronto in chemistry
00:29 

00:29 but also he knows a lot about chemical
00:31 

00:31 weapons he knows a lot about
00:33 

00:33 peacekeeping training and I'm delighted
00:36 

00:36 that he has come to speak to us about
00:38 

00:38 the evolution of international
00:39 

00:39 institutions thank you Walter for coming
00:42 

00:42 Erica thank you so much I really
00:44 

00:44 appreciate uh being with you and with
00:46 

00:46 your students uh delighted to work with
00:48 

00:48 you and over the years and now to
00:51 

00:51 present and share um so I'm going to
00:53 

00:53 speak about the evolution of
00:54 

00:54 international organization and that's
00:56 

00:56 because uh in our current day we see the
00:59 

00:59 international organizations are under
01:01 

01:01 siege you have US president Donald Trump
01:04 

01:04 who is withdrawn from the World Health
01:06 

01:06 Organization just after a major pandemic
01:09 

01:09 struck the Earth um you also have
01:11 

01:11 withdrawing from major un institutions
01:13 

01:13 like the institution that helps gazin at
01:16 

01:16 a time of their desperate need and we
01:18 

01:18 have uh all kinds of challenges even to
01:20 

01:20 the international law including trade
01:23 

01:23 law like the threat of trade
01:25 

01:25 tariffs uh which is can be challenged in
01:28 

01:28 the world um Trade Organization ation
01:31 

01:31 and uh the United States is not even
01:33 

01:33 abiding by the World Trade Organization
01:35 

01:35 rulings so we have to look at you know
01:38 

01:38 how do how do we get to this place um
01:41 

01:41 where we are now and realize that this
01:43 

01:43 is actually a behavior that was typical
01:46 

01:46 of 100 to 200 years ago this is normal
01:50 

01:50 behavior of humanity and then we say
01:52 

01:52 well how did we create all these
01:54 

01:54 institutions that we take for granted
01:56 

01:56 and I'm going to uh do a quick
01:58 

01:58 historical overview to show the
01:59 

01:59 evolution of international
02:01 

02:01 organization wow that's great okay great
02:04 

02:04 I uh I'll do so very much in the Simpson
02:06 

02:06 fashion with lots of uh lots of slides
02:09 

02:09 lots of eye candy to share so you can
02:11 

02:11 get that the visual Dimension to go
02:13 

02:13 along with the um the content thank you
02:17 

02:17 Walter you're very welcome okay so uh
02:20 

02:20 this is our planet planet Earth uh known
02:22 

02:22 at this particular image is called Blue
02:24 

02:24 Marble and we are floating in outer
02:27 

02:27 space and we seem to be a pretty amazing
02:29 

02:29 planet if you look at it from outer
02:31 

02:31 space all the astronauts seem to come
02:34 

02:34 back with with a different realization
02:35 

02:35 of our common Humanity having seen the
02:37 

02:37 world as whole and from outer space and
02:41 

02:41 we realize that it's actually a
02:43 

02:43 beautiful planet with um a very thin
02:45 

02:45 atmosphere that's very vulnerable it's
02:47 

02:47 only 1% of the diameter of the earth and
02:51 

02:51 it's it's a very vulnerable atmosphere
02:53 

02:53 but we rely on it for our very existence
02:56 

02:56 now if you looked more carefully at it
02:57 

02:57 you see there are so many Global
02:59 

02:59 challenges we have aggression and
03:01 

03:01 conflict weapons of mass destruction and
03:04 

03:04 mass murder we have diseases and climate
03:07 

03:07 uh huge climate changes climate change
03:10 

03:10 problems crime and terrorism human
03:12 

03:12 trafficking cyber threats and so much
03:14 

03:14 more so this peaceful planet is actually
03:16 

03:16 filled with with problems and you might
03:18 

03:18 under ask yourself how do the
03:21 

03:21 inhabitants of this planet deal with
03:23 

03:23 these problems what's what's the best
03:26 

03:26 that they're doing to be able to deal
03:27 

03:27 with these things and in order to to see
03:30 

03:30 that you'd have to look at how
03:31 

03:31 International Organization has evolved
03:33 

03:33 and I'll start off with um the first
03:36 

03:36 cataclysmic uh World War it was the
03:39 

03:39 World War I and there was a clash of
03:41 

03:41 Empires where countries felt that they
03:44 

03:44 could rule other areas of the earth and
03:47 

03:47 their colonies and they were challenging
03:49 

03:49 each other fighting over colonies and
03:52 

03:52 they uh came to a a major catastrophic
03:55 

03:55 War some 15 million killed in that war
03:59 

03:59 but afterwards was an idea that maybe we
04:01 

04:01 can do things better we don't have to
04:03 

04:03 have the the right of conquest or we we
04:06 

04:06 can't have governance without the
04:08 

04:08 consent of the of the Govern and so this
04:11 

04:11 was the origin of International
04:12 

04:12 Organization for peace and it came in
04:14 

04:14 the Paris peace Conference of 199 and it
04:17 

04:17 came out of the woodro Wilson the US
04:19 

04:19 president who at the time thought the
04:21 

04:21 Europeans really have to do things
04:23 

04:23 differently if they're going to be able
04:25 

04:25 to survive and if the world is going to
04:27 

04:27 survive so he came up with 14 points the
04:29 

04:29 last of which which was to create a um
04:33 

04:33 he called it a general Association of
04:35 

04:35 Nations that must be formed under
04:37 

04:37 specific covenants with the purpose of
04:39 

04:39 affording mutual guarantees of political
04:41 

04:41 Independence and territorial Integrity
04:43 

04:43 to great and small states alike so you
04:46 

04:46 see the notion there that you should
04:47 

04:47 have other people should have political
04:49 

04:49 Independence and territorial Integrity
04:51 

04:51 that you just can't go and acquire
04:53 

04:53 another territory because you want to um
04:56 

04:56 like Russia is doing now over Ukraine
04:59 

04:59 it's just it's of violation a blatant
05:01 

05:01 violation of international law has being
05:02 

05:02 developed but this principle is fairly
05:05 

05:05 new it's uh it's 100 plus a few years
05:08 

05:08 old and uh we really have to fight for
05:11 

05:11 it so in the 1919 Paris peace conference
05:15 

05:15 woodro Wilson wanted to create this
05:17 

05:17 International Organization but the
05:19 

05:19 British uh prime minister Lloyd George
05:21 

05:21 he wanted to maintain the British Empire
05:24 

05:24 and uh the French Premier George closo
05:28 

05:28 he wanted to have a un uh sorry A League
05:30 

05:30 of Nations force that would be able to
05:32 

05:32 beat Germany if Germany attacked again
05:35 

05:35 and Wilson wanted a system based not on
05:38 

05:38 selfish National interest but on the
05:39 

05:39 broad International interest interest
05:41 

05:41 based on International ideals and we see
05:44 

05:44 this debate that between the
05:46 

05:46 narrow-minded nationalism and the
05:48 

05:48 broad-minded internationalism come again
05:50 

05:50 and again in human history and it's
05:52 

05:52 facing us once again now but of course
05:54 

05:54 we have a bigger better foundation on
05:57 

05:57 which to build in the great debate of
05:59 

05:59 1919 wood Wilson thought there had to be
06:02 

06:02 not a balance of power but one powerful
06:04 

06:04 group of Nations set off uh one single
06:08 

06:08 overwhelming powerful group of Nations
06:10 

06:10 who shall be the trustee of the Peace of
06:11 

06:11 the world so that Nations have to come
06:13 

06:13 together in collective security not just
06:15 

06:15 Collective defense against an enemy but
06:18 

06:18 against collective security against
06:19 

06:19 anyone who would violate international
06:21 

06:21 law but Henry C Lodge Jr the chairman of
06:26 

06:26 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
06:27 

06:27 thought we should keep the United States
06:28 

06:28 out of the league and he wanted America
06:31 

06:31 to be much more choosy about when it
06:33 

06:33 intervened and not based on
06:34 

06:34 international law so the United States
06:37 

06:37 did say out of the League of Nations for
06:39 

06:39 um the 15 years that the league existed
06:42 

06:42 um and of course World War II came and
06:45 

06:45 the United States was was shaken out of
06:47 

06:47 a stuper by the attack on Pearl Harbor
06:49 

06:49 in
06:50 

06:50 1941 and it joined the uh Nations to
06:53 

06:53 fight against Germany and Japan and then
06:55 

06:55 realized well hey we have to do
06:57 

06:57 something better than what we did after
06:59 

06:59 the first world war we got a create a
07:00 

07:00 stronger League of Nations which they
07:02 

07:02 called the United Nations and so the uh
07:05 

07:05 properties and the principles of the
07:07 

07:07 league became incorporated into a better
07:09 

07:09 and stronger United Nations and the
07:11 

07:11 headquarters moved from Geneva to New
07:13 

07:13 York and the UN managed to do something
07:15 

07:15 League never did it chained
07:18 

07:18 universality the um the 193 members of
07:22 

07:22 the UN represent pretty much all the
07:24 

07:24 people of the globe and so we you can
07:27 

07:27 see that there's hardly any more new
07:29 

07:29 nations to join um after s Sudan joined
07:33 

07:33 in 2011 and then Montenegro before that
07:36 

07:36 and Timor Lee in um 2002 and this is a
07:41 

07:41 real achievement of bringing human
07:43 

07:43 beings together from all around the
07:44 

07:44 planet and what do they get together for
07:46 

07:46 well to maintain International Peace and
07:48 

07:48 security to have equal rights and
07:51 

07:51 self-determination of peoples to solve
07:53 

07:53 International problems and harmonize the
07:55 

07:55 actions of Nations it's all according to
07:58 

07:58 the UN Charter which also says that
08:00 

08:00 there's a sovereign equality of all its
08:02 

08:02 members it's like under the law in
08:04 

08:04 Canada one person doesn't have more
08:06 

08:06 legal rights than another that they have
08:08 

08:08 equality under the law and the UN
08:11 

08:11 Charter also asks in Article 2 paragraph
08:14 

08:14 4 that states refrain in their
08:16 

08:16 international relations from the threat
08:17 

08:17 or use of force against the political
08:19 

08:19 Independence or territorial integrity
08:22 

08:22 that's again coming right of woodro
08:23 

08:23 Wilson's 14th point and they also agreed
08:27 

08:27 all those 193 Nations agreed to accept
08:29 

08:29 and Carry Out the decisions of the
08:30 

08:30 security
08:31 

08:31 Council the UN Charter also provides for
08:34 

08:34 peaceful settlement of disputes for
08:35 

08:35 negotiations inquiry mediation Etc and
08:38 

08:38 referral to
08:40 

08:40 courts it also has this provision which
08:43 

08:43 is the enforcement provision um in
08:45 

08:45 chapter 7 of the UN Charter where
08:48 

08:48 Nations and the UN can apply sanctions
08:51 

08:51 and actually use military force to back
08:53 

08:53 international law but it has a big
08:55 

08:55 caveat saying that Nations uh have an
08:58 

08:58 inherent right of self-defense when they
09:00 

09:00 are under attack not if they're thinking
09:03 

09:03 an attack will come but if an armed
09:04 

09:04 attack occurs until the security Council
09:07 

09:07 has taken actions there are other
09:09 

09:09 chapters um for regional organizations
09:11 

09:11 social and economic uh progress because
09:14 

09:14 Nations realized that part of the
09:15 

09:15 problem of the rise of Nazi Germany and
09:19 

09:19 and Imperial Japan was social and
09:21 

09:21 economic conditions after World War I so
09:23 

09:23 they realized we had to create an
09:24 

09:24 international organization that also
09:26 

09:26 dealt with
09:27 

09:27 that so the UN has a general assembly a
09:30 

09:30 security Council an economic and social
09:32 

09:32 Council a truste ship Council which
09:34 

09:34 doesn't exist anymore and an
09:35 

09:35 international court of justice as well
09:37 

09:37 as a Secretariat headed by a un
09:39 

09:39 Secretary General and a lot of the
09:42 

09:42 action the headquarters is in New York
09:44 

09:44 and the Secretariat is this tall glass
09:46 

09:46 building on 1 Avenue and the Secretary
09:48 

09:48 General has his office on the 38th floor
09:51 

09:51 security council meeting by the East
09:52 

09:52 River down on the in this picture here
09:55 

09:55 and the economic social Council the
09:57 

09:57 other side and the general assembly is
09:59 

09:59 that big building with the Dome top that
10:00 

10:00 you see there so the general assembly
10:03 

10:03 has all members all 193 each has five
10:05 

10:05 representatives and one country has one
10:07 

10:07 vote and you need a two-thirds majority
10:10 

10:10 to get a substantive decision and and a
10:12 

10:12 just a simple majority that is half Maj
10:15 

10:15 half the votes in order to get a
10:17 

10:17 procedural motion passed resolution and
10:20 

10:20 they meet in September uh usually the
10:22 

10:22 heads of state come for the opening of
10:24 

10:24 the new session of the general assembly
10:25 

10:25 they also have special sessions the
10:27 

10:27 security Council in 194 five the member
10:31 

10:31 states um who were negotiating in San
10:34 

10:34 Francisco who were wanted to join and
10:37 

10:37 become part of this organization um they
10:40 

10:40 agreed very reluctantly that some
10:43 

10:43 nations in fact the most powerful
10:45 

10:45 Nations at the time would have a seat on
10:47 

10:47 the security Council now that's been
10:49 

10:49 pretty much Frozen in time except for a
10:51 

10:51 switch from uh kumintang China to
10:53 

10:53 People's Republic of China but it's a um
10:56 

10:56 it's really a reflection of the world
10:58 

10:58 order of 1945 and unfortunately they
11:00 

11:00 didn't create a mechanism by which new
11:02 

11:02 states can automatically be part of the
11:04 

11:04 security Council if they rise in power
11:07 

11:07 uh or there's other mechanisms for uh
11:09 

11:09 creating a security Council permanent
11:11 

11:11 members that are more fair but there are
11:14 

11:14 10 permanent members now and um these
11:17 

11:17 they come from different regions of the
11:18 

11:18 world Africa Asia Eastern Europe Western
11:21 

11:21 uh Europe and Latin America but there's
11:23 

11:23 lots of problems there's lots of Pol
11:25 

11:25 politics being played in the security
11:26 

11:26 Council and Russia has vetoed so many
11:28 

11:28 resolutions dealing with
11:30 

11:30 Ukraine I myself managed to get a little
11:32 

11:32 seat for at least a few seconds at the
11:35 

11:35 UN Security Council I took that picture
11:37 

11:37 in the the year that uh Canada was
11:39 

11:39 trying to get a seat on the security
11:40 

11:40 Council Unfortunately they they didn't
11:42 

11:42 but I
11:43 

11:43 did joking aside here's the economic and
11:46 

11:46 social Council which Canada does chair
11:47 

11:47 now Bob Ray our ambassador in the UN is
11:50 

11:50 is the chair of the eoso and it also
11:53 

11:53 oversees the specialized agencies and
11:57 

11:57 the NOS now you may try and guess these
11:59 

11:59 I don't have much time time to to to uh
12:01 

12:01 allow you to time to think about what
12:03 

12:03 they are but the first is the
12:04 

12:04 international civil aviation
12:05 

12:05 organization based in Montreal second
12:07 

12:07 one is international labor organization
12:09 

12:09 third is international Maritime
12:11 

12:11 organization and you can look at the
12:12 

12:12 others and see if if any of them you can
12:14 

12:14 guess maybe the UNICEF one number six
12:16 

12:16 you can
12:17 

12:17 guess so here they are the international
12:20 

12:20 telecommunication Union on the second
12:22 

12:22 level UNESCO United Nations educational
12:24 

12:24 scientific and culture organization
12:26 

12:26 UNICEF children's organization Universal
12:29 

12:29 Postal Union World Health Organization
12:31 

12:31 and World Meteorological or organization
12:34 

12:34 all important in their own areas for
12:36 

12:36 dealing with global problems which
12:37 

12:37 require Global Solutions more broadly we
12:40 

12:40 have an organization to deal with atomic
12:42 

12:42 energy human rights refugees and really
12:45 

12:45 importantly now the World Trade
12:47 

12:47 Organization so if nations are unfairly
12:50 

12:50 um imposing tariffs then the World Trade
12:54 

12:54 Organization has uh mechanisms to be
12:57 

12:57 able to do hearings on them
12:60 

12:60 and if Nations really abide by the WTO
13:02 

13:02 we'd be able to solve them the UN has
13:05 

13:05 agencies funds and programs as well so
13:08 

13:08 NOS have expanded very much at the UN I
13:10 

13:10 was just applying for an annual pass
13:12 

13:12 today for an NGO representing at the UN
13:15 

13:15 that's the Canadian pugwash
13:17 

13:17 group there's also the judicial branch
13:20 

13:20 which is the international court of
13:21 

13:21 justice based in the he uh trust ship
13:23 

13:23 Council which no longer has a purpose
13:26 

13:26 because all of those territories have
13:28 

13:28 gained independence and the UN
13:30 

13:30 Secretariat headed by a Secretary
13:32 

13:32 General with a department of Peace
13:33 

13:33 operations that has some 60,000 uniform
13:36 

13:36 Personnel in different hotspots in the
13:38 

13:38 world the secretaries General have uh
13:41 

13:41 been from different parts of the world
13:42 

13:42 if you look at the list top it's um trig
13:45 

13:45 Lee then comes Sweden trig Lee from
13:48 

13:48 Norway then D Harold from Sweden uon
13:51 

13:51 from Burma Kurt Vol time from Austria
13:53 

13:53 AIA pqu from Peru budris budris Gali
13:56 

13:56 from Egypt Ganan from Ghana bony Moon
13:59 

13:59 from South Korea and Antonio gues from
14:03 

14:03 Portugal now what have what has the
14:05 

14:05 organization achieved I mean I talk
14:07 

14:07 about these uh long perspective
14:09 

14:09 centuries achievements well the UN has
14:11 

14:11 been around for over 75 years and what
14:14 

14:14 can you say it has achieved well number
14:15 

14:15 one decolonization if you look at the
14:18 

14:18 when the UN was created there were so
14:20 

14:20 many nations that were colonies and that
14:22 

14:22 decolonization process really sped up in
14:24 

14:24 the 1960s and here you can see the
14:26 

14:26 different years when the different
14:29 

14:29 Nations got their
14:31 

14:31 independence we also had the adoption of
14:34 

14:34 the universal Declaration of Human
14:35 

14:35 Rights which is used in many national
14:38 

14:38 constitutions uh including our own and
14:41 

14:41 it's uh something that's very widely
14:43 

14:43 accepted all around the world through
14:45 

14:45 specific covenants that come out of the
14:48 

14:48 uh udhr Universal Declaration of Human
14:50 

14:50 Rights we also have the development of
14:52 

14:52 international law uh dealing with the
14:54 

14:54 sea through the UN conventional law of
14:56 

14:56 the sea outer space treaty a whole bunch
14:58 

14:58 of disarm treaties that are very
14:60 

14:60 important um and we have international
15:02 

15:02 criminal law which is just started to
15:05 

15:05 evolve after the nurg trials in 1945 46
15:09 

15:09 there was um a long pause where we
15:11 

15:11 didn't have an international criminal
15:13 

15:13 court until quite recently it created in
15:16 

15:16 2002 and uh we have an international
15:18 

15:18 prosecutor who's actually now indicted
15:21 

15:21 the president of Russia and the prime
15:22 

15:22 minister of Israel it's a very bold
15:25 

15:25 moves to challenge power there are times
15:27 

15:27 when the security Council played a major
15:29 

15:29 Ro like the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
15:33 

15:33 where um the Ambassador adelay Stevenson
15:36 

15:36 would challenge the Russians and he
15:39 

15:39 actually showed pictures of missiles in
15:40 

15:40 order to prove to the world that Russia
15:42 

15:42 was Kanda steinley putting missiles into
15:45 

15:45 Cuba lots of in progress on peace
15:48 

15:48 peacemaking and peacekeeping so
15:50 

15:50 peacekeeping the first peacekeeping
15:52 

15:52 force was created at the initiative of
15:53 

15:53 Lester B Pearson the Canadian Secretary
15:55 

15:55 of State of the time in 1956 to solve
15:58 

15:58 the Suez Crisis and he managed to
15:60 

15:60 convince D Harold that this was a good
16:03 

16:03 idea and then many more peacekeeping
16:06 

16:06 missions were created all around the
16:07 

16:07 world to deal with hot spots and to help
16:10 

16:10 resolve them so that's a way that
16:12 

16:12 International presence can be felt on
16:14 

16:14 the ground to have the eyes and ears of
16:15 

16:15 the UN
16:17 

16:17 there of course there have been
16:18 

16:18 difficult situations like Somalia Rwanda
16:22 

16:22 Bosnia and general delir has uh
16:25 

16:25 described in great detail in his book
16:27 

16:27 shake hands with the devil how he was
16:29 

16:29 facing those who were committing the
16:31 

16:31 genocide and killing some 800,000 people
16:35 

16:35 but with just 300 peacekeepers deair was
16:37 

16:37 able to save 20,000 to 30,000 lives uh
16:41 

16:41 because they were they were showing a
16:43 

16:43 presence and the general CS didn't want
16:44 

16:44 to do their Slaughter in front of the
16:47 

16:47 the UN so there was still an example
16:49 

16:49 even though Rwanda is overall a failure
16:51 

16:51 of the of the International Community
16:53 

16:53 but the UN was able to do amazing things
16:55 

16:55 with a very small Force there and we
16:58 

16:58 have um the bosia situation and my
17:00 

17:00 friend Patrick reckner was actually
17:02 

17:02 chained to a antenna as a human shield
17:05 

17:05 against NATO bombing but subsequently
17:07 

17:07 released and um and now Bosnia is at
17:11 

17:11 peace after several peace
17:13 

17:13 operations I remember when Patrick that
17:15 

17:15 happened to Patrick um because he was
17:18 

17:18 terribly uh how long has he changed to
17:21 

17:21 that poll while a few weeks well few
17:23 

17:23 weeks he
17:24 

17:24 Wass or days I can't remember but it was
17:27 

17:27 terrible for him and also I just want to
17:29 

17:29 emphasiz how many troops did uh General
17:32 

17:32 Romeo delir ask for only 500 troops and
17:35 

17:35 he got zero but you were saying that he
17:37 

17:37 he used 300 to prevent some of the
17:40 

17:40 genocide um so originally the unir force
17:43 

17:43 was
17:44 

17:44 5,000 they never quite got it to their
17:46 

17:46 authorized strength um then he then the
17:49 

17:49 Secretary General sent to the security
17:50 

17:50 Council three options to reduce the
17:52 

17:52 force down to 300 or to increase it to
17:56 

17:56 20,000 or to keep it as is and he said
17:58 

17:58 the current that as is is not working so
18:01 

18:01 the security Council authorized the
18:03 

18:03 strength to go down to just 300 and um
18:06 

18:06 and or 250 I think it was and general
18:09 

18:09 deir with almost 300 troops managed to
18:13 

18:13 save all those lives this is an example
18:15 

18:15 students of how important it is to to
18:18 

18:18 remember these numbers to know the facts
18:20 

18:20 you can see that Dr Doran has an
18:22 

18:22 incredible memory for facts and even
18:25 

18:25 there you know recalling what happened
18:27 

18:27 in the past he can remember all this and
18:29 

18:29 that important so that's why I will quiz
18:32 

18:32 you on a lot of these dates a lot of
18:33 

18:33 these times uh and also a lot of the
18:36 

18:36 pictures and keep that in mind for the
18:38 

18:38 multiple choice so I'm looking at it now
18:40 

18:40 and thinking well what can I do for
18:42 

18:42 multiple choice remembering that the
18:43 

18:43 students can remember pretty well
18:45 

18:45 everything that you say Walter so keep
18:47 

18:47 going this is an excellent lection
18:48 

18:48 lecture I I really really appreciate it
18:50 

18:50 sure we can make the PowerPoint
18:52 

18:52 available so anyone can look at it
18:53 

18:53 afterwards oh okay that would be great
18:56 

18:56 so this is a plaque at my college the
18:58 

18:58 Canadian Forces College here in Toronto
19:00 

19:00 which shows the names of those who died
19:02 

19:02 it was the graduating class of 99 who
19:05 

19:05 gave this to the college and it's those
19:08 

19:08 who served in peacekeeping operations
19:10 

19:10 and died in that
19:11 

19:11 cause um we have an expansion of
19:14 

19:14 peacekeeping so originally they were
19:15 

19:15 doing just military observers then they
19:17 

19:17 did buffer zones and and armed interos
19:20 

19:20 interposed forces and then
19:21 

19:21 multi-dimensional where they're doing so
19:23 

19:23 many activities including police
19:25 

19:25 monitoring and bring police into the
19:27 

19:27 into the missions they did economic and
19:30 

19:30 social reconstruction and judicial work
19:32 

19:32 so just a tremendous amount of of
19:35 

19:35 expansion of peacekeeping tasks and here
19:38 

19:38 is a graph since 1991 of the number of
19:41 

19:41 peacekeepers uniform peacekeepers that
19:43 

19:43 is military and police deployed to the
19:45 

19:45 field and in the cold war is typically
19:47 

19:47 around 10,000 then it went to 880,000
19:49 

19:49 then in the new century it really
19:51 

19:51 expanded to get to 108,000 and now since
19:55 

19:55 Trump was elected the first time it
19:57 

19:57 started to go down you see it's down now
19:58 

19:58 to around
19:59 

19:59 uh well 60 or
20:01 

20:01 70,000 um uniform personnel and then the
20:04 

20:04 UN has used enforcement sanctions many
20:06 

20:06 times during the Cold War only twice in
20:08 

20:08 Rhodesia and South Africa but then
20:10 

20:10 afterwards many times and they used
20:13 

20:13 military enforcement Action For the
20:14 

20:14 First Time an international organization
20:16 

20:16 used force in Korea in 1950 to repel
20:19 

20:19 aggression big step forward for Humanity
20:22 

20:22 now I have to also there you have
20:24 

20:24 Afghanistan 1999 till now see 1999
20:28 

20:28 Afghanistan
20:29 

20:29 for sanctions present those are the
20:31 

20:31 sanctions yeah okay yeah yeah thank you
20:35 

20:35 going on to other areas of progress
20:38 

20:38 there's a huge achievement of humanity
20:41 

20:41 bringing uh hundreds of millions of
20:43 

20:43 people out of poverty and actually even
20:45 

20:45 though Humanity has grown from six
20:47 

20:47 billion at the turn of this uh
20:49 

20:49 Millennium to currently 8 billion
20:52 

20:52 there's actually fewer people who are
20:54 

20:54 desperately po desperately poor um so
20:57 

20:57 that's really a testament to the
20:59 

20:59 effectiveness of our Global AIDS
21:02 

21:02 strategies and it's very unfortunate
21:04 

21:04 that uh president Trump has cut off the
21:07 

21:07 funding and is firing the employees of
21:09 

21:09 the largest Aid organization in the
21:11 

21:11 world the usaid which is agency for
21:13 

21:13 International
21:14 

21:14 Development um also eradication we
21:17 

21:17 actually took a disease and took it off
21:21 

21:21 of the earth so that it it could no
21:23 

21:23 longer bother Humanity again and we'd
21:25 

21:25 like to do this with other things like
21:26 

21:26 polio but there's still a difficulties
21:29 

21:29 of completely eradicating that so going
21:32 

21:32 to uh to a conclusion we have a huge
21:36 

21:36 humanitarian challenges in different
21:38 

21:38 parts of the world today um there's a
21:41 

21:41 huge need for international organization
21:44 

21:44 to get involved for peacekeeping forces
21:46 

21:46 and for humanitarian law IHL
21:49 

21:49 International humanitarian law to apply
21:51 

21:51 to these areas so we can get proper
21:53 

21:53 conduct of military and um non-military
21:57 

21:57 forces but in the UN we see that it's
21:60 

21:60 not able to act as a world government um
22:02 

22:02 it it there's still these competing
22:04 

22:04 Tendencies between sovereignty and the
22:06 

22:06 international rules and Norms that
22:08 

22:08 there's a unilateralism like the US
22:11 

22:11 unilateralism up today versus Collective
22:13 

22:13 action working together for a better
22:14 

22:14 world and that a lot of States put all
22:17 

22:17 the emphasis on their rights under
22:18 

22:18 international law but don't put any
22:20 

22:20 emphasis on their obligations and that's
22:22 

22:22 like Canada we contribute only 22 uh
22:25 

22:25 military personnel to un peacekeeping
22:27 

22:27 right now when our our average um for
22:30 

22:30 the during the Cold War was 1 10,000
22:33 

22:33 deployed um and then there's a last
22:36 

22:36 principle of power versus uh principle
22:38 

22:38 that is that uh so many nations really
22:41 

22:41 spend their time uh thinking about power
22:44 

22:44 and the real politic and realism they
22:47 

22:47 don't think about principle or values or
22:49 

22:49 the international rules so they uh we
22:52 

22:52 have this huge challenge it's true that
22:54 

22:54 most Nations abide by most laws most of
22:57 

22:57 the time but the outli are so uh
22:60 

22:60 egregious and so obvious that it makes
23:03 

23:03 the news every day when these kind of
23:05 

23:05 violations of international law happen
23:08 

23:08 so these challenges that I was
23:09 

23:09 mentioning at the beginning they are
23:11 

23:11 Global problems whether when one nation
23:13 

23:13 is attacked by another it's a problem
23:15 

23:15 for all of us because there it's like uh
23:16 

23:16 when one person is murdered uh it's a
23:19 

23:19 problem for all of us and we have to
23:20 

23:20 create the international mechanisms to
23:22 

23:22 deal with that just as we do at the
23:23 

23:23 national level we have police to
23:25 

23:25 investigate murders we need it the same
23:26 

23:26 thing to be done at the international
23:28 

23:28 level and all of these areas require
23:31 

23:31 strong International organizations so
23:32 

23:32 the Mantra here is that Global problems
23:35 

23:35 require Global Solutions and fortunately
23:38 

23:38 we have something to build on the UN has
23:40 

23:40 saved the world so many times uh from
23:42 

23:42 full-blown disasters and conflicts and
23:45 

23:45 uh otherwise we could very well have
23:47 

23:47 seen World War II but we have been able
23:49 

23:49 to keep this precious Planet at least in
23:52 

23:52 some semblance of condition so most of
23:54 

23:54 us can live peacefully most of the time
23:58 

23:58 and that's us again on planet Earth as
24:00 

24:00 we try and make this a better place on
24:03 

24:03 which we can all inhabit in peace and uh
24:07 

24:07 under the rule of
24:08 

24:08 law thank you very
24:11 

24:11 much well thank you Walter uh Dr Dorne
