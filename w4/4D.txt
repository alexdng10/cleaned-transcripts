00:00 welcome to the first part of our lecture
00:02 

00:02 on Canada's peacekeeping tradition
00:05 

00:05 War Fighters or peacekeepers question
00:09 

00:09 mark what we're talking about here is
00:11 

00:11 U.N peacekeeping first the tradition of
00:14 

00:14 U.N peacekeeping and definitions of
00:16 

00:16 peacekeeping then we go on to talk about
00:18 

00:18 multi-dimensional operations including
00:21 

00:21 the concept of peacekeeping training we
00:24 

00:24 focus on Canada's peace support
00:26 

00:26 operations another word for peacekeeping
00:28 

00:28 and then we begin to discuss Afghanistan
00:32 

00:32 which we will consider in in much more
00:34 

00:34 detail in the other lectures I talk a
00:38 

00:38 little bit about Latvia but mainly
00:40 

00:40 that's in the NATO lecture and Mali
00:42 

00:42 Canada has withdrawn from Mali and we
00:46 

00:46 also try to do a in class exercise on
00:49 

00:49 Mali that I talk about
00:52 

00:52 so Canada's peacekeeping tradition
00:54 

00:54 stretches back all the way to Lester B
00:56 

00:56 Pearson who's pictured there receiving
00:58 

00:58 the Nobel Peace Prize in
01:01 

01:01 1957. we also shared the Nobel Peace
01:05 

01:05 Prize in 1988 because of our
01:07 

01:07 contributions to peacekeeping in 1992
01:11 

01:11 that's the statue at the close to the
01:15 

01:15 National Gallery in Ottawa and I was
01:17 

01:17 involved in deciding on the selection of
01:20 

01:20 the peacekeepers there and some of the
01:23 

01:23 debates in 94 I was involved with the
01:26 

01:26 Canadian Institute for strategic studies
01:28 

01:28 efforts to establish a peacekeeping
01:30 

01:30 training center in Sydney I wasn't
01:33 

01:33 involved in that part but I was involved
01:35 

01:35 in the Cornwallis one and then it goes
01:37 

01:37 on there you can see that the back of
01:39 

01:39 the Canadian dollar has the same statues
01:42 

01:42 and then when you meet people in the
01:44 

01:44 Canadian Forces they may be carrying
01:46 

01:46 ribbons that denote various operations
01:49 

01:49 the back of the Canadian dollar also had
01:52 

01:52 as peacekeepers I've been on radio and
01:55 

01:55 debated with the major general Lewis
01:57 

01:57 McKenzie I've met many times Romeo
02:00 

02:00 delaire and had dinner with him and
02:02 

02:02 talked about the Rwanda genocide and of
02:05 

02:05 course there's a movie you can watch it
02:07 

02:07 counts with the devil as well so Canada
02:09 

02:09 has a rich peacekeeping tradition and
02:12 

02:12 many many symbols of our involvement
02:15 

02:15 what is peacekeeping uh here's the UN
02:18 

02:18 definition which is a bit outmoded
02:21 

02:21 because we used to think that you had to
02:23 

02:23 have the consent of all the parties to
02:25 

02:25 the conflict so that was difficult in
02:28 

02:28 Somalia that would be very difficult in
02:31 

02:31 Ukraine to have all of the consent of
02:34 

02:34 all of the parties but that's one of the
02:36 

02:36 arguments that's been made about Ukraine
02:38 

02:38 that we can't have a peacekeeping force
02:40 

02:40 because it will be impossible to get the
02:42 

02:42 parties Ukraine and Russia to agree I
02:45 

02:45 don't think that's true and we'll talk
02:46 

02:46 more about how peacekeeping can be used
02:49 

02:49 but that's just a general definition
02:51 

02:51 there that I'd like you to read over
02:55 

02:55 what we're going to talk about first is
02:57 

02:57 the evolutionary model of peacekeeping
02:59 

02:59 how peacekeeping has evolved from
03:01 

03:01 traditional first generation
03:03 

03:03 peacekeeping to the multi-dimensional
03:05 

03:05 operations that we see now in
03:08 

03:08 Afghanistan and Kosovo so formally we
03:12 

03:12 called uh peacekeep we used to use the
03:14 

03:14 word peacekeeping now we say p f k s o
03:17 

03:17 or peacekeeping support operations uh
03:20 

03:20 some people will say peace enforcement
03:22 

03:22 essentially we're describing the
03:24 

03:24 movement from the first generation where
03:26 

03:26 peacekeepers were observers and were
03:29 

03:29 unarmed all the way to multi-dimensional
03:32 

03:32 operations and the insistence on working
03:35 

03:35 on Administration government voting and
03:39 

03:39 so on so expanding and of course
03:41 

03:41 becoming much much more expensive for
03:44 

03:44 the United Nations
03:47 

03:47 so the first type of peacekeeping was
03:50 

03:50 demonstrated here in between North and
03:54 

03:54 South Korea I actually saw this area
03:57 

03:57 from the demilitarized zone in South
04:00 

04:00 Korea and that is where the South the
04:04 

04:04 North Koreans killed some peacekeepers
04:07 

04:07 with knives and hatchets before everyone
04:10 

04:10 shocked eyes and so this is a picture of
04:14 

04:14 the peacekeepers reacting to that
04:17 

04:17 Slaughter so at that time peacekeepers
04:20 

04:20 didn't carry weapons
04:24 

04:24 their functions were as observers to
04:26 

04:26 Monitor and to verify with the agreement
04:29 

04:29 of all the parties so they were unarmed
04:33 

04:33 soldiers and they were also expected to
04:35 

04:35 somehow diplomatically intervene so was
04:39 

04:39 it dangerous most of the operations were
04:42 

04:42 not really that Canada was involved in
04:44 

04:44 initially so Canada was in Cyprus for
04:47 

04:47 over 30 years and often when you meet
04:49 

04:49 older folks that were in the reserves or
04:52 

04:52 that were in the Canadian Forces they
04:54 

04:54 were deployed in Cyprus and they have
04:56 

04:56 good memories of that except for a brief
04:60 

04:60 war in 1974 between the Greek cypriots
05:04 

05:04 and the Turks my friend General Clayton
05:08 

05:08 B was the Canadian commander in charge
05:11 

05:11 of all the U.N forces during the war and
05:14 

05:14 I worked very extensively with him in
05:16 

05:16 the 1980s I have 1990s and I have very
05:19 

05:19 fond memories of him he would often
05:22 

05:22 recount to me the war and and his
05:25 

05:25 decision making
05:28 

05:28 so second generation peacekeeping began
05:32 

05:32 to talk about interposing
05:34 

05:34 inter-positioning forces between the
05:37 

05:37 warring parties and the goal was to keep
05:40 

05:40 them separate using peacekeeping forces
05:42 

05:42 the peacekeepers would still be serving
05:45 

05:45 in battalions but armed for self-defense
05:48 

05:48 only and they would not use particularly
05:51 

05:51 heavy Army armor but just light weapons
05:55 

05:55 so the classic example of that was the
05:58 

05:58 UNIF to the United Nations emergency
06:01 

06:01 force in the Middle East in 1956 which
06:05 

06:05 is where Pearson proposed a UNF
06:08 

06:08 emergency force and later got the Nobel
06:11 

06:11 Prize for his efforts
06:13 

06:13 okay
06:25 

06:25 you have to here you can see the forces
06:28 

06:28 continue to stay on in Suez City and I
06:32 

06:32 want you to look at the blue helmets the
06:33 

06:33 UN traditionally
06:35 

06:35 officials or soldiers no matter what
06:38 

06:38 country they come from all where blue
06:41 

06:41 helmets
06:45 

06:45 so interpositional peacekeeping also
06:48 

06:48 entailed separating warring forces so
06:51 

06:51 the UN would use all types of light
06:54 

06:54 armored vehicles you can see that
06:56 

06:56 they're white here and they're marked by
06:59 

06:59 a blue flag and the United Nations words
07:02 

07:02 so they would interpose themselves
07:07 

07:07 United Nations force and Cyprus is
07:10 

07:10 called unfossip and it's the principal
07:13 

07:13 example of interpositional peacekeeping
07:16 

07:16 as it evolved so it was created
07:18 

07:18 initially in 1964 and they drew these
07:21 

07:21 green lines to separate the cypriots and
07:24 

07:24 from the Turks then the Turks invaded in
07:28 

07:28 1974 and although
07:32 

07:32 um unfa sip is still in operation it's
07:35 

07:35 really seen to be a kind of a static
07:38 

07:38 example of interpositional peacekeeping
07:41 

07:41 that's gotten really nowhere to figure
07:43 

07:43 out what to do with this island is still
07:46 

07:46 in operation yes and Joe Clark was a un
07:50 

07:50 Envoy who was supposed to try to figure
07:54 

07:54 out a solution who was Joe Clark
07:57 

07:57 he was Canada's prime minister he was a
08:01 

08:01 conservative and once he retired as
08:04 

08:04 prime minister he tried to help the
08:06 

08:06 United Nations in many ways
08:10 

08:10 third type of
08:13 

08:13 third generation of peacekeeping is is
08:16 

08:16 often called multi-dimensional and it
08:19 

08:19 came to dominate it meant that
08:21 

08:21 peacekeeping became much much more
08:23 

08:23 complicated
08:27 

08:27 member a student in my classes years ago
08:30 

08:30 was actually deployed on this mission in
08:34 

08:34 Ethiopia and Eritrea and he recounted
08:37 

08:37 how as a military Observer he his duties
08:41 

08:41 it were much more complicated in terms
08:44 

08:44 of separating the uh the combatants
08:48 

08:48 so that's a new type of peacekeeping
08:51 

08:51 force
08:53 

08:53 and what I want to highlight here but
08:56 

08:56 it's not on the exam is the difference
08:58 

08:58 between Cold War peacekeeping and post
09:00 

09:00 Cold War peacekeeping so cold war was
09:04 

09:04 more interstate between Eritrea and
09:06 

09:06 Ethiopia between states
09:09 

09:09 and then it gradually moved more to
09:11 

09:11 Interstate conflict like Somalia
09:13 

09:14 Warlords fighting in Somalia or
09:17 

09:17 different
09:18 

09:18 um groups fighting within the former
09:20 

09:20 Yugoslavia but Kosovo versus the
09:23 

09:23 serbians so that's one of the main
09:26 

09:26 evolutions and then of course it moved
09:29 

09:29 from
09:31 

09:31 ceasefires focusing on observing to more
09:34 

09:34 multi-dimensional peace agreements so
09:37 

09:37 you don't have to memorize this but it's
09:39 

09:39 just a useful table
09:42 

09:42 the new types of peacekeeping involve
09:44 

09:44 Naval operations
09:47 

09:47 they involve Air Force operations
09:50 

09:50 including drones
09:53 

09:53 and they involve more U.N negotiations
09:56 

09:56 and State Building these are all parts
09:58 

09:58 of multi-dimensional operations now see
10:01 

10:01 the on their shoulders how they have the
10:03 

10:03 U.N peacekeeping badges
10:07 

10:07 the multi-oper dimensional operations
10:09 

10:09 involve everything from helping the
10:11 

10:11 police to set up lawyers reconstructions
10:14 

10:14 building schools and so on
10:20 

10:20 peacekeeping has come to include the
10:22 

10:22 protection of strategic sites even
10:24 

10:24 nucrocytes uh bases and so on these are
10:27 

10:27 important too
10:30 

10:30 multi-dimensional peacekeeping also can
10:33 

10:33 involve pre-deployment for example in
10:35 

10:35 Macedonia so as to prevent a conflict
10:40 

10:40 we also now expect Aid to the Civil
10:42 

10:42 Authorities so the problem became that
10:45 

10:45 the military and civilian peacekeepers
10:47 

10:47 maybe they were involved in elections or
10:49 

10:49 in monitoring they went from being
10:52 

10:52 professional combat capable soldiers to
10:55 

10:55 being soldiers trained as Engineers to
10:58 

10:58 get rid of landmines or as bureaucrats
11:00 

11:00 to set up elections and so on it became
11:02 

11:02 much more complicated and
11:05 

11:05 multi-dimensional
11:08 

11:08 for example Europe U.N peacekeepers
11:10 

11:10 building roads in Cambodia where there
11:13 

11:13 were landmines they were you can see
11:15 

11:15 here that the money that's involved in
11:17 

11:17 obtaining all this kind of Hardware is
11:20 

11:20 difficult too
11:23 

11:23 so many of these specialized tasks
11:26 

11:26 require specialized skills and a lot
11:28 

11:28 more money so demobilization
11:31 

11:31 reintegration police and so on are much
11:35 

11:35 more complicated
11:39 

11:39 I want to sum up by showing that you can
11:42 

11:42 become involved as a peacekeeper by
11:44 

11:44 volunteering at National and Municipal
11:47 

11:47 elections for example if you volunteer
11:49 

11:49 as an observer at the Municipal
11:51 

11:51 elections coming up
11:52 

11:53 then you will have increasing
11:54 

11:54 responsibilities and I've known quite a
11:56 

11:56 few students who've ended up going to
11:58 

11:58 East Timor or going to Africa to Uganda
12:01 

12:01 to be part of electoral organization
12:03 

12:03 this is one way that you can become
12:05 

12:05 involved
12:08 

12:08 the UN is involved with nation building
12:11 

12:11 for example they helped with the
12:14 

12:14 inauguration of the first namibian
12:15 

12:15 president
12:20 

12:20 let me now talk about enforcement and
12:22 

12:22 peacekeeping so this is a word for
12:25 

12:25 robust peacekeeping which involves much
12:28 

12:28 more active and violent aerial and Naval
12:31 

12:31 enforcement it can involve protection
12:33 

12:33 against snipers intelligence gathering
12:36 

12:36 monitoring from the skies rapid reaction
12:40 

12:40 forces drones to conduct surveillance
12:43 

12:43 and so on
12:46 

12:46 generation peacekeeping involved due to
12:48 

12:48 many difficult situations in the 1990s I
12:51 

12:51 spoke about Romeo delaire pictured there
12:54 

12:54 with the Beret and his terrible terrible
12:56 

12:56 experience in Rwanda with the genocide
12:59 

12:59 uh I I A friend of mine right there
13:02 

13:02 pictured uh he was uh captured hostage
13:05 

13:05 Patrick in Serbia and he was held there
13:09 

13:09 for a few days the whole world watched
13:11 

13:11 him as he was chained to uh or he was
13:14 

13:14 tied to a a telephone pool as a hostage
13:17 

13:17 so this there were many many difficult
13:20 

13:20 situations in the 1990s
13:24 

13:24 and robust peacekeeping continued to
13:26 

13:26 evolve so it began to use more more
13:29 

13:29 sophisticated helicopters and drones
13:32 

13:32 Griffins
13:35 

13:35 combat uh helicopters on all sides
13:40 

13:40 the fourth generation peacekeeping used
13:43 

13:43 transitional Administration so for
13:46 

13:46 example it tried to administrate
13:48 

13:48 countries that means that Syria which is
13:52 

13:52 a country on its own we will probably
13:54 

13:54 not have a peacekeeping operation there
13:56 

13:56 because to administrate Syria apart from
13:60 

13:60 the difficulties of of even getting in
14:02 

14:02 there would mean
14:03 

14:03 trying to run an entire government so
14:06 

14:06 there's a picture there in British
14:08 

14:08 pounds of where U.N peacekeepers have
14:10 

14:10 been deployed and you can see that most
14:12 

14:12 of it is most of the deployments have
14:14 

14:14 been in the global South
14:19 

14:19 a big step therefore would be to move
14:22 

14:22 peacekeeping to actually
14:24 

14:24 governing territories during a
14:26 

14:26 transitional period and this is very
14:28 

14:28 very difficult and expensive the goal
14:31 

14:31 might be to turn Afghanistan over to
14:33 

14:33 become a stable government that's
14:36 

14:36 governed by a local election a
14:38 

14:38 democratically elected leadership but as
14:40 

14:40 we will learn in the Afghanistan case
14:42 

14:42 study this proved this comprehensive
14:45 

14:45 approach proved to be a complete failure
14:50 

14:50 so a newer concept that entails less
14:53 

14:53 multi-dimensional operations and more
14:56 

14:56 modest goals is called security sector
14:58 

14:58 reform Dr sakin and poor was one of my
15:02 

15:02 PhD students for five years and he wrote
15:05 

15:05 an excellent uh thesis on SSR his
15:09 

15:09 argument was that in Afghanistan
15:12 

15:12 NATO needs to spend much more on
15:14 

15:14 training the police and also the army
15:18 

15:18 and also trying to work with
15:21 

15:21 the CIA on judicial and legal operations
15:25 

15:25 and intelligence collection and trying
15:27 

15:27 to use NATO to disarm the general
15:30 

15:30 population so that was SSR
15:34 

15:34 there's other cases of SSR not just
15:37 

15:37 Afghanistan so I put a few examples
15:39 

15:39 there where we had the United Nations we
15:43 

15:43 started working toward SSR so we're
15:45 

15:45 still in Kosovo but the other operations
15:48 

15:48 have ended Kosovo is still ongoing hard
15:51 

15:51 to believe 24 years
15:55 

15:55 U.N interim Administration in Kosovo
15:59 

15:59 operates under NATO auspices for the U.N
16:02 

16:02 so NATO is in charge of the security
16:04 

16:04 there it is a very complicated operation
16:07 

16:07 where they are trying for fairly small
16:09 

16:09 area to administrate many many things
16:12 

16:12 everything from banking to Law and Order
16:14 

16:14 other multilateral organizations are
16:18 

16:18 also full Partners but it's NATO
16:20 

16:20 military forces that are keeping the
16:22 

16:22 peace or the security there
16:25 

16:25 I want to mention that the East Timor
16:28 

16:28 operation I mentioned before some
16:30 

16:30 students and in fact my colleague Dr
16:32 

16:32 Walter Dorn went there and himself
16:34 

16:34 observed people being shoved into a
16:37 

16:37 church and burned alive
16:39 

16:39 uh because they were
16:42 

16:42 um executed that way is very powerfully
16:44 

16:44 affected by that
16:46 

16:46 um so East Timor that operation of SSR
16:49 

16:49 essentially failed
16:53 

16:53 Canada's peacekeeping operation in Mali
16:56 

16:56 um has also ended you can see where
16:59 

16:59 Molly is there on the map and Canadian
17:01 

17:01 Forces joined with the French
17:03 

17:03 they have a very strong anti-surgent
17:06 

17:06 operation in Africa and there was some
17:11 

17:11 um questions about whether we should
17:13 

17:13 join with France because the extremists
17:16 

17:16 that are in Mali had so far not targeted
17:20 

17:20 or threatened Canadian interests but it
17:23 

17:23 was part of a un contribution and Canada
17:27 

17:27 pulled out of Mali after six months the
17:30 

17:30 Trudeau government was criticized
17:31 

17:31 internally for example
17:34 

17:34 within the UN for pulling out and that
17:37 

17:37 affected our quest to obtain a U.N
17:40 

17:40 security Council seat
17:43 

17:43 the UN diplomats expected that the
17:46 

17:46 defense minister at that time hard
17:48 

17:48 decision would commit to Malia instead
17:51 

17:51 they wanted to delay the decision and
17:53 

17:53 they argued that they needed to work
17:55 

17:55 with the United States and and consult
17:57 

17:57 the Trump Administration in the end
17:59 

17:59 Canada did commit forces for six months
18:02 

18:02 but no and no and no Canadian lives were
18:04 

18:04 lost
18:06 

18:06 the decision to exit Molly is already
18:09 

18:09 forgotten as a peacekeeping support
18:11 

18:11 operation
18:14 

18:14 or the discussion question I'd like you
18:16 

18:16 to think about on your own is whether
18:17 

18:17 Canada should have contributed 200
18:20 

18:20 Canadian Forces to the U.N operation in
18:22 

18:22 Mali why should we go in why should we
18:25 

18:25 go out maybe we should contribute
18:27 

18:27 elsewhere like other countries in Africa
18:30 

18:30 or in the Middle East or in Central Asia
18:33 

18:33 in Afghanistan and is this a form of
18:36 

18:36 colonialism that Canada is involved
18:43 

18:43 let me turn to the fact that Canada
18:45 

18:45 became one of the lowest troop
18:46 

18:46 contributors to U.N operations under
18:48 

18:48 prime minister Harper so you can see
18:50 

18:50 there in 2011 we joined the ranks of
18:53 

18:53 other countries like Rwanda Bangladesh
18:56 

18:56 we had been a huge contributor for many
18:58 

18:59 years but we moved down to position
19:01 

19:01 number 53 with only 197 U.N troops
19:07 

19:07 troops committed solely to U.N
19:09 

19:09 operations that doesn't include
19:11 

19:11 Afghanistan
19:13 

19:13 I'll get into that in a minute why why
19:15 

19:15 is Afghanistan different
19:18 

19:18 so critics often cite the United Nations
19:20 

19:20 failure to prevent disasters they want
19:22 

19:22 to talk about why did the United Nations
19:25 

19:25 not help with the Arab Spring why did
19:28 

19:28 all this wave of revolutions all across
19:31 

19:31 the Arab world which was met with
19:32 

19:32 crackdowns in Bahrain Syrian Yemen why
19:36 

19:36 why with all these protested the United
19:40 

19:40 Nations fail
19:42 

19:42 to help and this is something that you
19:45 

19:45 can think about and talk to others about
19:46 

19:47 can the United Nations can it help with
19:50 

19:50 violent resistance in the Middle East
19:52 

19:52 today
19:53 

19:53 now no peacekeeping can fail so that
19:56 

19:56 sets a precedent amongst oppressive
19:58 

19:58 regimes all around the world that might
20:00 

20:00 say oh well we can oppress people
20:03 

20:03 without consequences the UN is never
20:05 

20:05 going to come in here and do anything
20:06 

20:06 the un's powerless so what can be done
20:09 

20:09 so these are some of the critics
20:11 

20:11 criticisms and criticisms
20:13 

20:14 critics and criticisms
20:17 

20:17 another criticism is that peacekeepers
20:20 

20:20 become part of the problem
20:22 

20:22 because of uh rape and because of sexual
20:26 

20:26 sexual exploitation of local populations
20:29 

20:29 so there's been a lot of research on
20:32 

20:32 trafficking and the spread of HIV AIDS
20:35 

20:35 due to peacekeepers for example there
20:39 

20:39 was a big U.N inquiry in 2005 that found
20:42 

20:42 U.N peacekeepers in the Democratic
20:45 

20:45 Republic of Congo were sexually abusing
20:48 

20:48 girls as young as 13 and there's also
20:51 

20:51 been allegations that the U.N Personnel
20:54 

20:54 abused children in southern Sudan so I'm
20:56 

20:56 bringing that up that that is part of
20:59 

20:59 the problem as well
21:02 

21:02 so this leads to no correct answers to
21:05 

21:05 this but do you think that the United
21:07 

21:07 States and Canada should continue to
21:10 

21:10 contribute more forces to the United
21:12 

21:12 Nations
21:14 

21:14 and or NATO so maybe should we
21:18 

21:18 contribute rapid reaction forces in
21:21 

21:21 Ukraine should we think about going back
21:23 

21:23 into Afghanistan
21:25 

21:25 what about Libya was that a colonial
21:28 

21:28 experiment what about Mali should we
21:30 

21:30 become involved in more countries in
21:32 

21:32 Africa this is a very complex question
21:35 

21:35 to answer and I I don't want you to
21:38 

21:38 worry if you have no idea what to answer
21:40 

21:40 right now because you need to hear more
21:42 

21:42 in the in the rest of these modules
21:46 

21:46 foreign so here I put a picture of
21:49 

21:49 Trudeau here he's meeting with forces in
21:51 

21:51 Latvia should Canada contribute to Iraq
21:54 

21:54 to Latvia we'll talk about this more in
21:57 

21:57 future weeks
