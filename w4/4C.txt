03:07 Achievement Award for peace writings
03:12 

03:12 so I'm going to be talking to you today
03:14 

03:14 about Afghanistan and I was hoping uh to
03:17 

03:17 just introduce you some of the problems
03:19 

03:19 and the dilemmas of Afghanistan so I'll
03:22 

03:22 just share another screen with you and
03:23 

03:23 we will go through my PowerPoint
03:24 

03:24 together quickly
03:35 

03:35 okay so Afghanistan and I'll just I'd
03:38 

03:38 like to use the laser pointer give me a
03:40 

03:40 second highlighter
03:44 

03:44 and there we are okay so I will be
03:46 

03:46 speaking on Wednesday June the 2nd from
03:48 

03:48 10 to 10 30 a.m and I hope to bring in a
03:51 

03:51 special guest who want to tell you a
03:52 

03:52 little bit more about in a few moments
03:55 

03:55 so the conflict in Afghanistan is one of
03:58 

03:58 the bloodiest in the world and it's the
03:59 

03:59 tenacity of the Taliban Isis or isil and
04:03 

04:03 the al-Qaeda Network that mean that the
04:06 

04:06 country cannot continue uh without to
04:09 

04:09 operate without help from NATO so often
04:12 

04:12 barrages of rockets hit the heavily
04:15 

04:15 fortified green zone where many
04:18 

04:18 embassies and international firms are
04:20 

04:20 based in the capital of Kabul so the
04:22 

04:23 number that are killed every day is
04:24 

04:24 unclear
04:27 

04:27 but for example in November last year 22
04:30 

04:30 people were killed and 27 were wounded
04:33 

04:33 when three isis-affiliated gunmen
04:35 

04:35 rampaged through Kabul University
04:37 

04:37 spraying classrooms with bullets for
04:40 

04:40 several hours so now that the United
04:42 

04:42 States and NATO have decided to entirely
04:45 

04:45 withdraw from Afghanistan by September
04:47 

04:47 11th observers and Afghans are worried
04:50 

04:50 about attacks on the city's universities
04:53 

04:53 the single International Airport and
04:55 

04:55 also on the Fortified green zone
04:58 

04:58 nobody knows why these attacks are
05:01 

05:01 carried out whether it's to pressure or
05:03 

05:03 defame or make the government look weak
05:05 

05:05 in front of its citizens or to
05:08 

05:08 strengthen positions at various uh
05:10 

05:10 bargaining tables however the debate at
05:13 

05:14 NATO continues to be whether it was
05:16 

05:16 short-sighted for the incoming U.S
05:18 

05:18 Administration under President Joe Biden
05:20 

05:20 to entirely first decide to drastically
05:23 

05:23 reduce the now entirely eliminate by
05:25 

05:25 September the number of American troops
05:27 

05:27 in Afghanistan this year
05:30 

05:30 the NATO allies are all following the
05:32 

05:32 United States lead and they have all
05:34 

05:34 decided to withdraw by September 11th so
05:37 

05:37 the risk is high that insurgents
05:39 

05:39 pictured here take over and the country
05:41 

05:41 becomes a strategic holding ground for
05:44 

05:44 the world's wealthiest and most lethal
05:46 

05:46 terrorist groups
05:49 

05:49 the intra-afghan negotiations here
05:52 

05:52 pictured here with the Taliban and
05:54 

05:54 elected governments representatives were
05:57 

05:57 tasked in September 2020 to find a
05:60 

05:60 long-term agreement but the two-sided
06:02 

06:02 talks that aim to end literally Decades
06:05 

06:05 of War have accomplished very little and
06:07 

06:07 are stalled in Doha Qatar
06:12 

06:12 the Army is underprepared and the police
06:14 

06:14 force to conduct a sustained campaign
06:16 

06:16 against the adversaries attacking in the
06:18 

06:18 rural areas pictured here Afghan forces
06:21 

06:21 will need rigorous security sector
06:23 

06:23 reform which means more disciplined and
06:27 

06:27 professionalization due in part to the
06:29 

06:29 Army's corruption and its drug use what
06:33 

06:33 is security sector reform SSR
06:36 

06:36 the heir to ground integration
06:38 

06:38 capability and the Afghan Air Force's
06:41 

06:41 a-29s given to them by the United States
06:43 

06:43 are proving sufficient but a new
06:46 

06:46 city-by-city defense plan needs a
06:49 

06:49 assiduous implementation here so here
06:51 

06:51 you can see the ground troops and the
06:53 

06:53 preparation of the national Army
06:58 

06:58 the nato-led Resolute support Mission or
07:01 

07:01 RSM was launched in 2015 and it was
07:04 

07:04 launched after isaph ended in 2014. so
07:08 

07:08 RSM provides training advice and and
07:11 

07:11 assistance and that will end its Mission
07:14 

07:14 and withdraw by September
07:17 

07:17 so approximately 12 000 Personnel from
07:21 

07:21 30 NATO member states and eight partner
07:24 

07:24 com countries have been deployed in RSM
07:27 

07:27 and they are operating in a non-combat
07:29 

07:29 mission from one Central Haven Kabul
07:32 

07:32 with spokes in four directions
07:36 

07:36 the NATO Secretary General here is NATO
07:39 

07:39 headquarters in Brussels uh and that's
07:41 

07:41 the the 30 uh flags of the 30 countries
07:44 

07:44 remain committed they say to Nate uh
07:47 

07:47 Afghanistan despite ending RSM and the
07:50 

07:50 United States separate combat Mission
07:52 

07:52 which is Operation Freedom Sentinel so
07:55 

07:55 the separate contingent of U.S forces
07:58 

07:58 participated in force protection in
08:01 

08:01 logistical support and counter-terrorism
08:04 

08:04 activities and this is according to
08:06 

08:06 various reports
08:09 

08:09 do you think that the United States
08:11 

08:11 should have remained in Afghanistan and
08:14 

08:14 for how much longer you think they
08:16 

08:16 should remain another 21 years another
08:18 

08:18 four years until November you may want
08:21 

08:21 to reflect at this point upon the
08:23 

08:23 implications of long-term involvement
08:25 

08:25 however please pay attention uh to the
08:28 

08:28 pictures taken by Dr saki namkipur here
08:31 

08:31 he is the senior advisor to the Minister
08:33 

08:33 of Defense in Afghanistan and he
08:36 

08:36 successfully defended his PhD
08:37 

08:37 dissertation on SSR under my Supervision
08:40 

08:40 in August 2020 and departed the next day
08:43 

08:43 for Afghanistan where he's on the war
08:44 

08:44 front and I'm hoping to bring him in by
08:47 

08:47 military satellite phone from the war
08:50 

08:50 front in June
08:52 

08:52 he just texted me uh he just literally
08:55 

08:55 texted me on my phone and there might be
08:57 

08:57 some interesting issues in that regard
09:01 

09:01 Saki and his boss the president of
09:03 

09:03 Afghanistan ashrafghani were taken by
09:06 

09:06 surprise in April just like me because
09:08 

09:08 we thought that the United States would
09:10 

09:10 undertake a conditions-based withdrawal
09:13 

09:13 and that this would last perhaps until
09:15 

09:15 the end of November and then at that
09:18 

09:18 point the United States would pause its
09:20 

09:20 troop Productions and reassess the
09:22 

09:22 situation this was certainly indicated
09:24 

09:24 by then you Secretary of Defense Mark
09:26 

09:26 esper
09:28 

09:28 but Esther was fired by President Donald
09:31 

09:31 Trump on November 10th and that upended
09:34 

09:34 the military leadership and led to the
09:36 

09:36 appointment of Christopher Miller as the
09:39 

09:39 acting secretary so Miller announced on
09:42 

09:42 November 17th the drawdown of troops
09:44 

09:44 from 4 500 to 2 500 U.S service members
09:49 

09:49 in Afghanistan and he also announced the
09:52 

09:52 drawdown from 3000 to 2500 in Iraq
09:57 

09:57 so the non-us Allies in Afghanistan
10:01 

10:01 especially Germany in the north and
10:03 

10:03 Italy which is deployed in the western
10:05 

10:05 herat Province bordering Iran decided to
10:08 

10:08 remain indeed the German government
10:10 

10:10 warned U.S administrators that the plan
10:13 

10:13 partial withdrawal of American trips
10:15 

10:15 troops risked putting peace in progress
10:17 

10:17 in the country in danger so here you can
10:20 

10:20 see the German foreign Ministry
10:22 

10:22 spokesperson Christopher Berger stating
10:25 

10:25 that premature withdrawal
10:28 

10:28 could jeopardize the negotiation process
10:32 

10:32 the two-sided one between the Afghan
10:34 

10:34 government and the Taliban and
10:36 

10:36 jeopardize the progress achieved so far
10:38 

10:38 in Afghanistan
10:40 

10:40 so that was a strong statement
10:43 

10:43 but once Biden decided to get out of
10:45 

10:45 Afghanistan Germany followed its lead at
10:48 

10:48 its peak the German Mission included 5
10:51 

10:51 000 German troops and now a total of
10:54 

10:54 nearly 1 100 German soldiers are being
10:57 

10:57 withdrawn from Afghanistan by September
11:01 

11:01 Italy had sent over 4 000 troops to
11:05 

11:05 fight against terrorism since 2099 2009
11:08 

11:08 Italy it seems has 895 that will be
11:12 

11:12 deployed that will be pulled out and
11:15 

11:15 part of the concern there relates to
11:16 

11:17 Iran's alleged alleged support to the
11:20 

11:20 Taliban so that meant that NATO saw
11:22 

11:23 sustaining the Italian deployment as
11:25 

11:25 important
11:27 

11:27 the missions in the United States and in
11:31 

11:31 the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq are
11:33 

11:33 are receiving very scant attention
11:36 

11:36 um
11:37 

11:37 the United States also has about 700
11:39 

11:39 troops in Somalia and and they are and
11:42 

11:42 they were seen as important cornerstones
11:44 

11:44 of global efforts to combat terrorism so
11:47 

11:47 a global pullback some argue means that
11:51 

11:51 future U.S administrations Democratic or
11:53 

11:53 republican could enter office burdened
11:55 

11:55 by unsolvable problems that are
11:58 

11:58 exacerbated by overhasty and
11:60 

11:60 irresponsible decision making right now
12:03 

12:03 thank you
12:05 

12:05 so here you can see the the very pivotal
12:08 

12:08 April 2021 uh decision on April 14th and
12:11 

12:11 here you can see the United States
12:12 

12:12 announcing and the Allies the foreign
12:15 

12:15 ministers and the defense ministers that
12:18 

12:18 consulted by Zoo
12:19 

12:19 um or and and following a meeting with
12:22 

12:22 the U.S assist the U.S Secretary of
12:24 

12:24 Defense and the U.S Secretary of State
12:26 

12:26 and they announced that all troops would
12:28 

12:29 vacate by Afghanistan before September
12:31 

12:31 11th before the 20th anniversary of the
12:34 

12:34 terrorist attacks on the World Trade
12:36 

12:36 Center and the Pentagon
12:39 

12:39 so the U.S withdrawal was portrayed by
12:42 

12:42 the U.S Secretary of State Anthony
12:44 

12:44 blinken as an accomplishment of
12:47 

12:47 America's goals however those goals were
12:49 

12:50 from the outset ambiguous and now their
12:52 

12:52 Clarity is lost in the in the annals of
12:54 

12:54 time what we do know and what is certain
12:57 

12:57 is that President Joe Biden was
12:59 

12:59 insistent that U.S troops would
13:01 

13:01 completely withdraw from The Quagmire
13:04 

13:04 meaning From the Muddy mess and the NATO
13:07 

13:07 allies immediately followed the United
13:09 

13:09 States hejaman's lead so I'm using that
13:11 

13:11 word hegemon to describe the U.S
13:14 

13:14 hegemony for this sudden decision
13:18 

13:18 here you can see NATO Secretary General
13:20 

13:20 Yen stoltenberg on that day saying our
13:23 

13:23 drawdown will be orderly coordinated and
13:25 

13:25 deliberate adding that we are united in
13:27 

13:27 leaving together which is putting a bold
13:29 

13:29 and a brave face on on the decision
13:34 

13:34 so is this a new chapter the news the uh
13:38 

13:38 blinken went straight the next day to
13:40 

13:40 Afghanistan and met with the Afghanistan
13:42 

13:42 government signaling a new chapter in
13:45 

13:45 the country's relationship but that news
13:47 

13:47 was relegated to the margins of the
13:49 

13:49 world's newspapers because of the
13:52 

13:52 prospect of a different Brewing war in
13:55 

13:55 Central Europe and this is over and in
13:57 

13:57 the context of Russia's mounting troop
13:60 

13:60 deployment
14:01 

14:01 next to Ukraine and NATO exercises in
14:05 

14:05 Ukraine and Ukraine's fears that could
14:07 

14:07 Russia could potentially steer store
14:10 

14:10 nuclear weapons in Crimea
14:12 

14:12 so the Allies France and NATO Allied
14:16 

14:16 Germany turned to that crisis Ukraine is
14:20 

14:20 not a NATO Ally but they turn to urge
14:23 

14:23 Russia to withdraw its troops at the
14:26 

14:26 Ukraine border so everyone focused on
14:28 

14:28 that crisis in Afghanistan fell by the
14:30 

14:30 wayside
14:32 

14:32 thank you
14:33 

14:33 we have to look at the fact that the
14:35 

14:35 United States is war weary their coffers
14:38 

14:38 are bare after military expenditures of
14:41 

14:41 nearly one trillion dollars on on Iraq
14:45 

14:45 and on Afghanistan and another 44
14:47 

14:47 billion on reconstruction projects that
14:50 

14:50 may in the future we don't know what
14:52 

14:52 will happen if the Taliban uh take over
14:54 

14:54 but certainly the United States is
14:56 

14:56 facing unprecedented catastrophic costs
14:59 

14:59 from covet related health concerns so
15:02 

15:02 who could really blame President Biden
15:04 

15:04 for wanting to get out of Afghanistan
15:06 

15:06 after 20 tumultuous and very painful
15:09 

15:09 years so here's some pictures taken from
15:11 

15:11 saki from the warfront and you can see
15:14 

15:14 that they're preparing night vision
15:16 

15:16 goggles and carrying things and
15:18 

15:18 preparing their weapons
15:21 

15:21 foreign States has endured thousands of
15:25 

15:25 combat-related deaths and PTSD injuries
15:27 

15:27 and the cost for 970
15:30 

15:30 000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans
15:33 

15:33 disability claims is going to become
15:35 

15:35 much larger over time exponentially
15:37 

15:38 larger meanwhile in the United States or
15:41 

15:41 in the in the Afghanistan's president's
15:43 

15:43 president presidential Palace here's
15:45 

15:45 president
15:46 

15:46 Afghani pictured here he seems to be
15:49 

15:50 holed up in the palace seeking or seeing
15:54 

15:54 Junior AIDS who allow him to think that
15:56 

15:56 completing a second term would somehow
15:58 

15:58 cement his legacy and we also can't
16:01 

16:01 forget former president Hamid Karzai who
16:04 

16:04 is waiting in the wings in the hope that
16:06 

16:06 a transfer of power will lead to a sea
16:08 

16:08 change in Afghanistan's fortunes so here
16:11 

16:11 you can see a picture that saki took of
16:14 

16:14 the troops
16:15 

16:15 foreign
16:18 

16:18 because the moving chess pieces will not
16:22 

16:22 change the fundamentals of Afghanistan's
16:25 

16:25 strategic situation it's caught in these
16:28 

16:28 vast planes mountains among moving Wards
16:33 

16:33 men intent on grabbing resources and
16:37 

16:37 usurping the authority such that in my
16:40 

16:40 view the Taliban Suns will be replaced
16:42 

16:42 by their grandsons raised in a culture
16:45 

16:45 of war and unable to countenance even
16:48 

16:48 the prospect of any kinds of concessions
16:53 

16:53 the women in Afghanistan it is widely
16:56 

16:56 feared that women and girls will suffer
16:59 

16:59 the most from gender inequality they
17:01 

17:01 already do especially in the rural areas
17:03 

17:03 outside the cities of Kabul and Kandahar
17:07 

17:07 Global Affairs did a survey and reported
17:10 

17:10 that 51 of Afghan women reported
17:14 

17:14 lifetime physical and sexual intimate
17:17 

17:17 partner violence
17:19 

17:20 the rate of child marriage was 35
17:24 

17:24 unbelievable and over 70 percent of
17:28 

17:28 females 15 and older are illiterate they
17:31 

17:31 cannot read
17:32 

17:32 that is compared to 44 of males
17:35 

17:35 shockingly High Canada has a 99
17:38 

17:38 literacy rate
17:42 

17:42 so what are some solutions we're not
17:45 

17:45 going to hear much from the women and
17:46 

17:46 children in Afghanistan again as the
17:49 

17:49 Taliban captures more ground from the
17:51 

17:51 Afghan National and secure National
17:53 

17:53 Defense and secure ensf
17:57 

17:57 a-n-d-s-f forces Afghan National Defense
18:00 

18:00 and security forces because they're
18:02 

18:02 commanded by old men pictured here who
18:06 

18:06 have given up any Prospect of winning it
18:09 

18:09 will be left up to the Next Generation
18:11 

18:11 probably three generations from now to
18:14 

18:14 agree upon some kind of solutions that
18:17 

18:17 involve disarmament some kind of arms
18:20 

18:20 verification and monitoring local and
18:23 

18:23 also International multilateral
18:26 

18:26 negotiations
18:27 

18:27 there will also have to be some kind of
18:30 

18:30 enforcement and a legislative end to
18:33 

18:33 indiscriminate bombing and there has to
18:36 

18:36 be among all sides renewed openness to
18:39 

18:39 electoral power sharing as well as
18:42 

18:42 elements of Taliban ideology will have
18:45 

18:45 to be mixed somehow with secular
18:47 

18:47 principles
18:50 

18:50 all these related pillars of security in
18:53 

18:53 my view could collapse a round shackle
18:55 

18:56 and abandon in a country with the
18:58 

18:58 world's lowest per capita GDP and some
19:03 

19:03 of the world's lowest not the absolute
19:05 

19:05 lowest but they do have the some of the
19:07 

19:07 world's lowest per capita GDP and
19:10 

19:10 literacy ratings so RSM was committed to
19:13 

19:13 training and funding the Afghan Security
19:15 

19:15 forces and it might have stayed with the
19:18 

19:18 conditions-based approach but in the end
19:21 

19:21 once President Biden rejected such
19:23 

19:23 thinking you can see here at the press
19:25 

19:25 conference the preferred entire Alliance
19:28 

19:28 option became total withdrawal
19:34 

19:34 hopeless and yet from the very beginning
19:35 

19:35 the entire Enterprise was doomed to
19:38 

19:38 failure because Al Qaeda is
19:41 

19:41 n't its nefarious cells can jump from
19:43 

19:43 one desperate Countryside in Afghanistan
19:46 

19:46 to Somalia to Mali to another conflicted
19:50 

19:50 area so the best way to defeat Al Qaeda
19:53 

19:53 back in 2001 would have been to set up
19:56 

19:56 counter-intelligence spying and secret
19:59 

19:59 surveillance systems
20:02 

20:02 that's my view
20:05 

20:05 and according to U.S intelligence
20:07 

20:08 officials that is still possible indeed
20:10 

20:10 easier after building a network of
20:12 

20:12 informers and spies in Afghanistan for
20:14 

20:14 the last 20 years
20:17 

20:17 never Lust For The Pentagon and the
20:20 

20:20 intelligence Community a key debate
20:22 

20:22 right now is weather counter-terrorism
20:24 

20:24 operations can be maintained from
20:27 

20:27 outside Afghanistan
20:31 

20:31 for Americans worried about the threat
20:33 

20:33 of terrorism eminent aging from
20:36 

20:36 Afghanistan
20:38 

20:38 when you look at the actual statistics
20:40 

20:40 covid related deaths car crashes and
20:43 

20:43 suicide are far more significant causes
20:46 

20:46 of death
20:48 

20:48 however it is sad to contemplate the
20:50 

20:50 impact on Afghans once the United States
20:53 

20:53 and NATO entirely withdraw and I think
20:56 

20:56 we could see an increasing stream of
20:58 

20:58 Afghans and civilians
21:01 

21:01 trying to get to the international
21:02 

21:02 airport as it is closed and so this will
21:05 

21:05 be reminiscent of Saigon in 1975 before
21:10 

21:10 it fell to the north of Vietnamese Army
21:13 

21:13 foreign
21:14 

21:14 I've invited some other speakers on
21:17 

21:17 Afghanistan Rory O'Connor also a former
21:20 

21:20 graduate student of mine who uh ended up
21:23 

21:23 can you can you stop the uh Federal
21:25 

21:25 public service you can stop now
21:28 

21:28 um
21:29 

21:29 yeah you can stop thank you
21:31 

21:31 um so I want to now turn to uh Dr
21:33 

21:33 nampour Who I see has been writing notes
21:35 

21:35 and I'm hoping that uh he can respond or
21:39 

21:39 can speak to us now thank you
21:42 

21:42 well thank you Erica am I audible I'm
21:45 

21:45 sorry if my internet connection it could
21:47 

21:47 be a little spotty I'm talking to you
21:49 

21:49 all the way from Kandahar Airfield
21:52 

21:52 um well it's great to be here
21:54 

21:54 um
21:55 

21:55 as we understand the security sector
21:57 

21:57 reform process in Afghanistan has been a
22:00 

22:00 long journey something that was hailed
22:03 

22:03 as a Panacea
22:05 

22:05 for in emerging Democratic countries
22:08 

22:08 such as Afghanistan
22:10 

22:10 very many tribulations very many
22:12 

22:12 challenges still exist uh the
22:14 

22:14 complexities are only being compounded
22:17 

22:17 with the withdrawal of NATO forces and
22:19 

22:20 the U.S forces from Afghanistan so
22:22 

22:22 there's a few things that I want to
22:24 

22:24 touch up uh touch upon Dr Simpson has
22:28 

22:28 touched upon some very important and
22:30 

22:30 interesting facts so I want to start
22:31 

22:31 about
22:33 

22:33 what state are we in currently currently
22:36 

22:36 in Afghanistan we're in the
22:38 

22:38 transformative face so this is
22:41 

22:41 the time where we're actually actively
22:44 

22:44 working on decentralization of security
22:47 

22:47 apparatuses meaning
22:49 

22:49 giving a lot of local
22:52 

22:52 police militia such as the Afghan local
22:54 

22:54 police district police and police
22:58 

22:58 commanders in different provinces all
23:00 

23:00 across Afghanistan namely the 34
23:02 

23:02 provinces that we have a greater
23:05 

23:05 autonomy to listen to people uh
23:08 

23:08 to understand what is really needed in
23:12 

23:12 these districts our issuing currently is
23:15 

23:15 that with the withdrawal of U.S forces
23:18 

23:18 yes we do control the major Urban
23:20 

23:20 centers in Afghanistan but we cannot get
23:22 

23:23 to the districts the rural districts for
23:25 

23:25 the most part are totally controlled by
23:28 

23:28 the Taliban we are on the front lines
23:30 

23:30 with them but the problem is that we do
23:33 

23:33 not have the air superiority that we
23:36 

23:36 enjoyed for the past 20 years uh the
23:38 

23:38 Afghan Air Forces uh Gravely under
23:41 

23:41 equipped underfunded and very minuscule
23:44 

23:44 compared to the uh might of the U.S
23:48 

23:48 forces when they we're providing us with
23:51 

23:51 full support
23:53 

23:53 um so in essence we're taking this
23:55 

23:55 approach of the second generation of SSR
23:58 

23:58 so just to kind of highlight over it the
24:01 

24:01 second generation of security sector
24:02 

24:02 reform essentially instead of just
24:05 

24:05 having a rigid and concrete form of
24:09 

24:09 policy to
24:13 

24:13 push government policy from top down we
24:15 

24:15 kind of are taking the bottom-up
24:17 

24:17 approach where we are involving
24:20 

24:20 Community activists Grassroots movements
24:23 

24:23 civil uh Society in our decision making
24:26 

24:26 process
24:27 

24:27 we are trying to see exactly what is
24:30 

24:30 needed to improve security outcomes in
24:32 

24:32 areas under our control
24:34 

24:34 and this is something new it will take
24:36 

24:36 time and especially with the withdrawal
24:39 

24:39 of U.S forces right now this issue is
24:41 

24:41 only getting more and more complex
24:44 

24:44 um
24:45 

24:45 the capabilities of the Afghan
24:48 

24:48 National Defense and security forces we
24:51 

24:51 are very capable in terms of defending
24:53 

24:53 the territory that we do have I know
24:55 

24:55 right now all over you know social media
24:59 

24:59 or global news networks and Outlets
25:01 

25:01 they're talking about the potential fall
25:03 

25:03 of the Kabul Administration uh one thing
25:06 

25:06 we can do assure them that Kabul
25:08 

25:08 Administration will not fall we are very
25:11 

25:11 much able to defend our provinces and
25:14 

25:14 our capital city and make and ensure the
25:18 

25:18 security of our diplomatic staffs we
25:20 

25:20 have very many great security
25:21 

25:21 Arrangements in place
25:24 

25:24 um in my capacity as advisor until a
25:27 

25:27 couple weeks ago we had set up some very
25:29 

25:29 many
25:31 

25:31 um robust plans which included the
25:34 

25:34 interception of threats and how to uh
25:38 

25:38 make sure the Metropolis of Kabul where
25:41 

25:41 over six and a half million people call
25:43 

25:43 it their home that it is secure from
25:45 

25:45 very many uh security threats of course
25:48 

25:48 as you can see a lot of cowardly attacks
25:52 

25:52 do take place all across Afghanistan
25:54 

25:54 especially in the Cabo you know what we
25:57 

25:57 call soft targets targeting
25:59 

25:59 uh targeted children targeting schools
26:04 

26:04 and this is something that goes against
26:06 

26:06 every single human value
26:10 

26:10 uh all across the world so
26:13 

26:13 that is one thing that we're talking
26:14 

26:14 about the fall of the administration is
26:16 

26:16 not imminent and it will not fall
26:19 

26:19 will there be complexities and
26:22 

26:22 the peace negotiations that are
26:25 

26:25 currently going on with Taliban
26:26 

26:26 absolutely
26:28 

26:28 our position in the government is that
26:30 

26:30 these peace negotiations went a little
26:33 

26:33 essentially it's a stalling tactic
26:36 

26:36 until the United States withdraws until
26:38 

26:38 the Taliban
26:40 

26:40 um draws upon their full capabilities to
26:43 

26:43 launch a full-scale civil war against us
26:46 

26:46 um there's very many foreign
26:48 

26:48 intelligence agencies which are involved
26:50 

26:50 we have credible intelligence day in day
26:52 

26:52 out where we do see who's supporting
26:54 

26:54 them the solution to Afghanistan for a
26:58 

26:58 large part does lie in Pakistan and
27:02 

27:02 Pakistan is a unique case because we see
27:06 

27:06 in other countries where a state has a
27:09 

27:09 military in Afghanistan
27:12 

27:12 we have a state
27:14 

27:14 we have the Afghan National Security
27:16 

27:16 Forces Pakistan is a unique case because
27:19 

27:19 the government essentially wields no
27:21 

27:21 power over the military and in Pakistan
27:24 

27:24 the military has a state
27:26 

27:26 where you see them controlling all
27:29 

27:29 aspects of foreign policy all aspects of
27:32 

27:32 uh their intelligence gathering
27:34 

27:34 techniques and their influences quite
27:37 

27:37 vast
27:38 

27:38 so as such any solution to the conflict
27:41 

27:41 in Afghanistan and to improve our
27:43 

27:43 security sector reform agenda
27:45 

27:45 essentially needs Pakistan's partnership
27:48 

27:48 how sincere is their approach we do not
27:50 

27:50 know
27:51 

27:51 when they wanted to have two professors
27:54 

27:54 released from captivity it did not take
27:57 

27:57 them long to have them released all the
27:59 

27:59 Pakistani government that was reached
28:01 

28:01 out to the military and the Taliban
28:02 

28:02 released them in a matter of couple days
28:04 

28:04 so we do know that they will
28:05 

28:05 considerable influence over them
28:08 

28:08 so the peace and Reconciliation process
28:10 

28:10 that I've been talking about
28:12 

28:12 it is very much in our opinion still a
28:15 

28:15 stalling tactic the red line for the
28:19 

28:19 Afghan government our position is that
28:21 

28:21 we will not acquiesce to the Taliban
28:23 

28:23 events to
28:25 

28:25 sacrifice the hard-earned rights that we
28:28 

28:28 have earned for women for children
28:30 

28:30 access to education democratic reform
28:34 

28:34 um the electoral process we will not go
28:36 

28:36 back to the stone ages again and we will
28:39 

28:39 not let presidents and dignitaries be
28:42 

28:42 dragged on the streets of Kabul and hung
28:44 

28:44 by a pole for the public to watch this
28:46 

28:46 will not happen again when we will not
28:48 

28:48 allow that
28:50 

28:50 um
28:51 

28:51 the Outlook
28:53 

28:53 as of now given the current security
28:55 

28:55 situation is that
28:58 

28:58 we expect to have a stalemate
29:02 

29:02 um and and there's a reason why I say
29:05 

29:05 that
29:06 

29:06 the United States they're withdrawing we
29:08 

29:08 have 352 000 Security Forces under our
29:12 

29:12 Command and we're very capable of
29:14 

29:14 protecting the areas that we do have
29:16 

29:16 but we lack the logistical support we
29:20 

29:20 lack the reconnaissance support
29:22 

29:22 and
29:24 

29:24 it's like the NATO and the US
29:27 

29:27 we're very grateful to them for what
29:29 

29:29 they have supported us for over the past
29:31 

29:31 21 years but it feels as if we're all of
29:34 

29:34 a sudden abandoned in middle of this
29:36 

29:36 conflict where it's only getting worse
29:38 

29:38 and this is not and this is probably in
29:40 

29:41 the past 20 years one years this is the
29:42 

29:42 worst point of the conflict
29:44 

29:44 in the past 21 years there hasn't been a
29:47 

29:47 single point
29:48 

29:48 in time where the conflict was worse
29:50 

29:50 than what it is today and we're being
29:53 

29:53 abandoned at a time where we definitely
29:57 

29:57 do need the international support but we
29:59 

29:59 are
30:00 

30:00 again we're ready for all eventualities
30:03 

30:03 uh we had prepared for this and
30:07 

30:07 again
30:08 

30:08 we do appreciate their political moral
30:12 

30:12 and financial support but the capacity
30:15 

30:15 building and
30:18 

30:18 combat support on the field is something
30:21 

30:21 that money can't buy and it's something
30:24 

30:24 that political support and through
30:26 

30:26 rhetoric can't be changed
30:28 

30:29 so as of now our position is very much
30:31 

30:31 that we will be in a stalemate our aim
30:34 

30:34 is for the next for this fighting season
30:37 

30:37 which is going to be starting later this
30:39 

30:39 month which the Taliban usually they
30:41 

30:41 release a media uh release that they
30:44 

30:44 have started off their fighting season
30:47 

30:47 our goal is to prevent most of these
30:50 

30:50 attacks and perhaps push them to their
30:52 

30:52 districts but it is proving
30:55 

30:55 difficult
30:56 

30:56 it has proven to be something where we
30:60 

30:60 see a lot of foreign fighters who are
31:02 

31:02 infiltrating Afghanistan right now we
31:05 

31:05 have credible intelligence that there
31:07 

31:07 are plans to bring in a lot of foreign
31:11 

31:11 Fighters once the United States leaves
31:13 

31:13 and that is going to be facilitative
31:15 

31:15 facilitated through the borders of
31:17 

31:17 Pakistan and Iran and how we intercept
31:19 

31:19 them and how we prevent Al Qaeda from
31:22 

31:22 taking a foothold on Afghan territory is
31:25 

31:25 another challenge that we're going to be
31:27 

31:27 dealing with
31:28 

31:28 um so as of now the security sector
31:31 

31:31 reform
31:33 

31:33 has taken on this image where it
31:36 

31:36 actually comes down to
31:38 

31:38 what have we accomplished over the past
31:40 

31:40 21 years or 20 and a half years
31:43 

31:44 and this will be borne out by evidence
31:46 

31:46 and the performance of Afghan troops
31:49 

31:49 and what we are expecting is that the
31:53 

31:53 morale and the discipline of the
31:55 

31:55 security institutions will hold
31:58 

31:58 we will make sure there are elections
31:60 

31:60 again we will make sure that the access
32:02 

32:02 to education women's rights and all
32:06 

32:06 these other Democratic successes which
32:09 

32:09 we have had such as having all these
32:12 

32:12 institutions access to these
32:13 

32:13 institutions
32:15 

32:15 um but these
32:17 

32:17 positive values will remain and Prevail
32:19 

32:20 for years to come but and in spite of
32:23 

32:23 all this you know
32:27 

32:27 kind of uh government release that I'm
32:30 

32:30 telling you about and you know I do not
32:33 

32:33 mean to sound like a government
32:35 

32:35 mouthpiece who's extremely optimistic
32:38 

32:38 I'm also kind of pointing out the
32:40 

32:40 challenges that we do have and the
32:42 

32:42 challenges we do have will be something
32:45 

32:45 that will be witnessed
32:47 

32:47 in the field and in our opinion the
32:49 

32:49 United States will have no choice but to
32:51 

32:51 re-engage Afghanistan they will have no
32:54 

32:54 choice to re-engage because if they want
32:56 

32:56 to prevent Al Qaeda from taking a
32:58 

32:58 foothold again they do need to
33:00 

33:00 vigorously support us
33:03 

33:03 until they either come to a negotiating
33:06 

33:06 table
33:07 

33:07 with
33:08 

33:08 complete honesty and sincerity or they
33:12 

33:12 acquiesce and disarm demobilize and
33:15 

33:15 reintegrated into the Afghan Society I'm
33:18 

33:18 going to stop right here and allow for
33:20 

33:20 any questions and I know time is short
33:22 

33:23 so Dr Simpson I hope I didn't go above
33:26 

33:26 what was allocated to me so I'll be
33:28 

33:28 happy any questions at this point in
33:30 

33:30 time well thank you very much saki uh
33:33 

33:33 that was a very interesting and also a
33:35 

33:35 bit discouraging
33:37 

33:37 um because I know you so well and and
33:39 

33:39 you are not your normal optimistic self
33:42 

33:42 um now saki has a very senior position a
33:44 

33:44 different position now in the
33:46 

33:46 Afghanistan government uh Benoit who's
33:49 

33:49 here on the uh in the gallery was in
33:52 

33:52 Afghanistan as part of the RCMP uh for
33:55 

33:55 three weeks and at that time he traveled
33:57 

33:57 in an armored personal carrier and had
33:59 

33:59 some security guards
34:01 

34:01 Zaki has his own armored personal
34:03 

34:03 carrier and just for the students here
34:05 

34:05 how many security guards do you have now
34:07 

34:07 saki
34:09 

34:09 well it's tough to keep count usually I
34:12 

34:12 have about uh
34:13 

34:13 30 30
34:15 

34:15 uh personal bodyguards with me
34:18 

34:18 and and he travels in an armored
34:20 

34:20 personal car everywhere
34:22 

34:22 um I don't see any questions but if you
34:24 

34:24 do have a question just uh unmute
34:27 

34:27 yourself please and then and put up your
34:30 

34:30 hand which you do by pressing reactions
34:32 

34:32 or just physically like Dr Dorn has done
34:34 

34:35 please just put up your hand so I saw Dr
34:37 

34:37 Dorne first coming in from uh BC from
34:41 

34:41 Squamish
34:43 

34:43 yeah thanks Erica and thanks for two
34:45 

34:45 great presentations
34:47 

34:47 um I want to focus on the peace process
34:48 

34:48 and and explore that a little bit with
34:50 

34:50 you
34:52 

34:52 um it's first of all looking at the past
34:53 

34:53 but now we can learn some lessons from
34:55 

34:55 the 20 years plus the
34:59 

34:59 um the peace process seemed to be really
35:02 

35:02 a secondary thought for most of those 20
35:04 

35:04 years and I think we lost an opportunity
35:08 

35:08 and I would like to be corrected if
35:10 

35:10 um if you have different views that we
35:12 

35:12 list missed opportunities to be peace
35:15 

35:15 process Centrics and to do legitimate
35:17 

35:17 negotiations when the um when the NATO
35:22 

35:22 and government forces were were really
35:25 

35:25 strong so even even in the early 2000s
35:29 

35:29 uh we didn't the the attitude was we
35:33 

35:33 don't negotiate with Paris and then
35:36 

35:36 during the U.S Obama surge uh was well
35:39 

35:39 let's uh let's uh first of all win on
35:43 

35:43 the battlefield and then we'll talk
35:44 

35:44 about peace so there really were missed
35:46 

35:47 opportunities so first of all comment on
35:48 

35:48 the past of Peace processes the present
35:51 

35:51 uh saki has already said that it's um
35:53 

35:53 it's like a holding they're just um
35:56 

35:56 using the peace process to stall while
35:59 

35:59 they're arming and and ready to attack
36:02 

36:02 but I do want to explore
36:05 

36:05 um the notion that there's a still a
36:07 

36:07 future for a peace process I mean maybe
36:09 

36:09 after more deadly conflict
36:13 

36:13 um but that there might be also
36:15 

36:15 possibility for peace process at a local
36:17 

36:17 level that is you know the talibanism is
36:20 

36:20 monolithic that was another big mistake
36:22 

36:22 during the 20 years to view the Taliban
36:25 

36:25 is was one force it's actually so many
36:26 

36:26 different groups with different
36:28 

36:28 supporters it's not just the question
36:29 

36:29 it's it's so many different aspects so
36:32 

36:32 what about local peace processes so I
36:34 

36:34 guess I question is you know for the
36:38 

36:38 Canadian peace research Association
36:39 

36:39 what's the prospect what are the lessons
36:41 

36:41 about the peace process and what are the
36:43 

36:43 prospects for the future
36:44 

36:44 can I just say one thing saki you can
36:46 

36:46 take your time because there are no
36:47 

36:47 other questions right now so and if you
36:49 

36:50 don't mind could you comment a little
36:51 

36:51 bit on the role of um Dr uh Paulo Conta
36:54 

36:54 ramosino please can you in terms of a
36:57 

36:57 behind the scenes negotiations
36:59 

36:59 and a peace process there
37:02 

37:02 right
37:03 

37:03 um I'm gonna answer uh Dr dorner's
37:06 

37:06 question first and I'll touch upon that
37:09 

37:09 um
37:10 

37:10 the peace process at the local level
37:12 

37:12 drone it has to be
37:15 

37:15 a community-led
37:17 

37:17 very Grassroots type of movement now how
37:21 

37:21 much effect does a local level peace
37:26 

37:26 process with the Taliban will lead to
37:29 

37:29 a cessation of violence and hostilities
37:33 

37:33 with the Afghan National Security Forces
37:36 

37:36 I think those are two words
37:39 

37:39 questions that I you know that there's
37:42 

37:42 just not enough time to answer that here
37:44 

37:44 but what I would like to say is that
37:46 

37:46 having peace with at the district level
37:48 

37:48 is a lot different than having peace
37:50 

37:50 with the legitimate government of
37:51 

37:51 Afghanistan
37:53 

37:53 um so the peace process essentially if
37:57 

37:57 it has to
37:58 

37:58 if we need to accept peace in exchange
38:00 

38:00 for
38:02 

38:02 sacrificing the Democratic uh
38:04 

38:04 achievements we have had over 20 and a
38:07 

38:07 half years for us that's not a peace
38:09 

38:09 process that's acquiescing to the
38:11 

38:11 taliban's demands we're not going to a
38:13 

38:13 an ultra conservative islamist
38:16 

38:16 government again which was only there to
38:19 

38:19 support you know which which only
38:22 

38:22 essentially existed as a proxy of other
38:25 

38:25 foreign intelligence agencies which are
38:27 

38:27 not a liberty to discuss here but the
38:29 

38:29 local peace process Dr Dorner I I would
38:31 

38:31 just like to touch upon this you're
38:33 

38:33 absolutely right there could be peace at
38:35 

38:35 the local level but but that doesn't
38:38 

38:38 necessarily mean peace with the
38:40 

38:40 legitimate government of Afghanistan
38:41 

38:41 there could be cessation of hostilities
38:43 

38:43 but at the same time that does not help
38:46 

38:46 with the administration of the
38:47 

38:47 government itself
38:52 

38:52 um okay uh we do have a question from an
38:55 

38:55 RCMP officer now saki's thesis also
38:58 

38:58 dealt with the police not just the
38:60 

39:00 Afghanistan national Army and so uh we
39:03 

39:03 have a question from Benoit did you want
39:05 

39:05 to unmute yourself yeah thank you uh Dr
39:08 

39:08 name for Server general question I had a
39:12 

39:12 colleague an RCMP officer who was the
39:15 

39:15 contingent commander in Kabul for one
39:17 

39:17 year
39:18 

39:18 and he wrote a book about a cups and
39:21 

39:21 cable and his premises in his book was
39:23 

39:23 that the frustration was that sometimes
39:25 

39:25 the military had a lot of influence over
39:27 

39:27 police training I just would like to uh
39:30 

39:30 listen to your opinion on that or
39:32 

39:32 general comments yes uh thank you for
39:35 

39:35 that Benoit you're absolutely right and
39:37 

39:37 in my thesis uh I discussed this
39:39 

39:39 extensively on it's pressure in my mind
39:42 

39:42 because I only defended last year
39:44 

39:44 um
39:45 

39:45 the issue as we have known this and it
39:49 

39:49 is very well known in the security
39:51 

39:51 sector reform Community is that the
39:53 

39:53 paramilitarization of the police has
39:56 

39:56 been a significant problem where
39:58 

39:58 Community civilian policing has been
39:60 

39:60 needed we have train our police to fight
40:04 

40:04 counterterrorism we have trained our
40:06 

40:06 police to prevent terrorism we have
40:09 

40:09 trained them to go after insurgents and
40:12 

40:12 nowhere in the world do you see this as
40:15 

40:15 an exclusive task of local police forces
40:17 

40:17 so our police
40:19 

40:19 are very much lacking in community
40:22 

40:22 civilian policing uh has made it very
40:26 

40:26 difficult to build a positive
40:28 

40:28 relationship from the very populous
40:30 

40:30 they're trying to uh enforce the law
40:32 

40:32 upon
40:33 

40:33 and what's happening is that you're
40:36 

40:36 seeing a backlash against you know
40:38 

40:38 police conduct and we see a heightened
40:42 

40:42 level of corruption mistrust uh
40:44 

40:44 questioning the legitimacy of the
40:46 

40:46 ministry of interior's entire purpose so
40:49 

40:49 we do see this on The Daily
40:55 

40:55 I I just wanted to mention
40:57 

40:57 um saki that Dr Carter ramosino is in
40:60 

40:60 the hospital
41:01 

41:01 um again so he wasn't able to come this
41:03 

41:03 morning
41:04 

41:04 yes so I just wanted to mention uh
41:08 

41:08 um well I uh Colin Paulo but Dr Carter
41:11 

41:11 uh ramasino he's a very very influential
41:15 

41:15 figure here in Afghanistan he's
41:17 

41:17 extremely well liked in the Afghan
41:19 

41:19 circles
41:20 

41:20 [Music]
41:20 

41:20 um
41:21 

41:21 he's very well respected here in
41:24 

41:24 Afghanistan believe it or not he's had a
41:27 

41:27 lot of success bringing Taliban leaders
41:29 

41:29 right to the negotiating table when the
41:31 

41:32 entire International Community had given
41:34 

41:34 up
41:35 

41:35 so he has he's an extremely influential
41:38 

41:38 figure and uh I've seen this firsthand
41:40 

41:40 he knows the president personally he
41:42 

41:42 knows my boss my former boss personally
41:46 

41:46 and
41:47 

41:47 um back in 2008 when the piece on this
41:50 

41:50 idea of a peace process and
41:52 

41:52 Reconciliation was coming up it was
41:53 

41:53 actually Paulo who reached out to the
41:55 

41:55 Taliban and had these uh secret meetings
41:58 

41:58 between himself the Taliban
41:60 

41:60 representatives and Afghan government
42:02 

42:02 Representatives so he's had a Monumental
42:07 

42:07 role in kick-starting the peace process
42:10 

42:10 and uh we would like to welcome him
42:12 

42:12 someday to Afghanistan uh like he's come
42:15 

42:15 here before and uh it'd be great to uh
42:19 

42:19 hear from him in the near future and
42:21

42:23 

42:23 see him in November
