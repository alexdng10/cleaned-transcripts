0:01
okay so we're going to talk now in more
0:04
detail about Afghanistan's dilemmas and
0:06
problems because this has been such an
0:08
issue not just for Canada but for the
0:10
world and also we're bringing in this
0:14
guy Dr saki nampour who's going to talk
0:17
to us about his experiences and this is
0:20
going to be like an indelible part of
0:22
the class so let's just talk a little
0:24
bit more about the problems
0:29
so what we saw with the sort of repeat
0:31
that one picture there but as the talks
0:34
dragged on and on and on The Afghan
0:37
government was still embroiled in
0:39
violent conflict against the Taliban
0:41
Insurgency combined with the what I
0:45
spoke about before the territory
0:46
expansion of daesh or isil so nobody was
0:50
actually negotiating with isil and the
0:53
prospect remained that daesh the same
0:55
thing would take over all of the Taliban
0:57
one territory even if they somehow came
1:00
to terms with some sort of power sharing
1:02
some sort of very unwelcome peace
1:05
agreement so
1:07
um this was the Dilemma
1:10
and I think in hindsight that most
1:14
experts agree that Biden Administration
1:16
should have announced a longer
1:17
withdrawal time in April of 2020 uh one
1:21
they wanted to withdraw by the 20th
1:25
anniversary of 9 11 and the attack on
1:28
the Pentagon and on New York City and so
1:31
they applied their own deadlines but
1:34
they should have consulted with the
1:35
Afghan government and they should have
1:37
withdrawn a lot more slowly
1:41
the Afghan president ghani was himself
1:44
very isolated withdrawn he did not
1:47
communicate except for with very senior
1:49
advisors and even then he was withdrawn
1:53
from those sorts of negotiations combine
1:56
that with the fact that the Afghan
1:58
National Defense Force was not trained
2:01
well enough to take on the Taliban and
2:03
probably never could have been they were
2:05
very seasoned fighting force
2:12
government promised not to allow Al
2:15
Qaeda a safe haven but how would they
2:18
have done that how would they have done
2:20
that the Taliban promised to negotiate
2:22
but they abandoned those promises and
2:25
they attacked all of the provincial
2:27
capitals slowly over the summer time of
2:31
2020
2:33
um one
2:36
so here's a a quote from Karzai the
2:40
former president whom I told you about
2:42
and uh he was running for election again
2:46
with
2:47
Abdullah Abdallah who was waiting in the
2:49
wings to take over so the whole
2:52
situation people argued was like Vietnam
2:54
and Saigon in the 1970s that there was
2:58
going to possibly be a mass Exodus of
3:00
the of the government and and they did
3:03
get ready
3:05
so the Americans tried to persuade us I
3:09
mentioned before to become part of the
3:11
Resolute support mission
3:13
I mentioned before that the Afghan
3:16
government only controlled 55 of the
3:18
country's districts so they were falling
3:20
rapidly
3:23
and I mentioned before my my trips to
3:25
Nato headquarters in 2018 and 2020. so
3:29
here you see I've updated the slide and
3:31
we met with Dr John Manza who was the
3:35
second he was the highest ranking
3:36
American Diplomat at NATO headquarters
3:38
in charge of all of NATO's operations
3:41
including in Afghanistan Kosovo Ukraine
3:45
and the naval operations we met with
3:49
Mark de Paulo who was head of NATO's
3:51
operations for Afghanistan and Iraq and
3:54
we met with Megan minion who was a
3:57
Canadian senior political advisor at
3:59
isaf so all these people were very
4:02
helpful
4:04
and to go on about the RSM I mentioned
4:07
before and I just want to emphasize that
4:09
they kept talking about
4:11
um about Canada's contributions to
4:13
Latvia as significant
4:18
so I mentioned before in the other
4:20
slides um just in case you missed that
4:22
that there this piece in Afghanistan
4:24
would have to somehow convert or
4:27
transition the Taliban to become a
4:30
political party and they would have to
4:31
share constitutional power so that was a
4:34
real dilemma
4:37
and the main problem too was women's
4:39
rights how would they be protected would
4:41
they be part of a government the Taliban
4:43
said definitely not
4:46
so I think that the Taliban maybe will
4:50
understand that if they treat women
4:51
badly as before that Afghanistan will
4:55
become a pariah State and Pakistan and
4:58
Iran and other countries will not want
4:59
to associate with them but the evidence
5:02
of the last few weeks since they took
5:04
over since I is that their promises are
5:08
easily broken they promise to it not to
5:11
attack civilians and they did they're
5:12
beating women in the streets
5:15
more than 40 000 members of the Canadian
5:18
Armed Forces served in Afghanistan
5:20
rotating
5:22
over Fort over nearly 14 years and
5:25
Isaiah mentioned so many times now 158
5:27
Canadian Armed Forces members died
5:31
so now what should be done so many
5:34
um women were left behind we helped them
5:37
to enter the workforce what will happen
5:38
now
5:42
seven Canadian civilians also passed
5:44
away with many many veterans suffering
5:47
still from PTSD
5:49
and they will be recovering for decades
5:53
so for those of us that were involved
5:55
with Afghanistan and we want to help now
5:57
we're talking about trying to solve
5:59
these dilemmas and problems one option
6:00
would be to sponsor a refugee on our own
6:03
but then we would have to join with
6:06
other organizations because the Canadian
6:08
rule is that you have to explain how you
6:10
will feed and house families of five or
6:13
more and how will you get that money
6:15
together
6:17
uh you if you're a private sponsor you
6:21
can work with groups of five
6:23
like NGO or church but you will as a
6:28
sponsorship agreement holder face heavy
6:31
bureaucratic burdens and we found that
6:33
that it's very difficult to sponsor
6:35
Afghans there's a lot of paperwork and
6:38
administration and a lot of money that's
6:40
needed to be put down
6:43
we also would need eventually to get the
6:47
applicant recognized as a refugee by the
6:49
United Nations Refugee agency unhcr or
6:54
as a refugee by a foreign State and of
6:55
course the Taliban is not going to do
6:57
that so I had initially advised Afghans
7:01
stuck in Afghanistan to take any kind of
7:04
transportation to get out to India
7:07
Pakistan to take buses to get out of
7:09
Kabul but that advice gradually became
7:12
much more dangerous because if they move
7:14
around their passports will be seen
7:19
Taliban are blocking roads they're
7:21
searching houses they're taking people's
7:24
cell phones away some friends of mine
7:27
are hiding in their basements fearful of
7:29
being captured
7:32
as one colleague wrote To Me Sick means
7:35
that his English is not very good we're
7:37
still alive but any second could end the
7:40
life my life anytime I can't stay in one
7:43
place I'm changing my location every
7:45
time in this time there's no way to
7:47
escape from the Taliban and then he went
7:49
on to write
7:51
the only way I can see that the US Army
7:54
helicopter swings save us to take us to
7:56
Kabul Airfield then another country
7:59
otherwise we have no way to become new
8:01
refugees I've lost my sleep I don't know
8:03
where I'm going so this was all
8:05
happening in August of 2021 it's very
8:10
very concerning
8:12
even if colleagues I knew a family of
8:15
five they did reach the kibble air
8:17
Airfield but two weeks after it was
8:20
closed down the runways were full of
8:22
American and European planes
8:25
transporting out their own citizens and
8:27
people who had helped them U.S president
8:30
also promised to keep bringing out
8:33
Afghan interpreters and Embassy staff
8:36
so it was full
8:39
so what will Canada do over the long
8:41
term the Prime Minister promised to take
8:43
in 40 000 Afghan refugees but now there
8:47
is a huge backlog and compared to his
8:50
promise to take in large numbers of
8:52
Syrian refugees he promised to take in
8:54
twenty thousand this will be a daunting
8:56
promise to fulfill Canada so Canada
8:59
brought-ins are nearly forty thousand
9:01
thirty nine thousand six hundred and
9:02
thirty six Syrian refugees in a very
9:05
short time period I don't know if you
9:07
remember that but Trudeau said that was
9:09
a very poignant part of his
9:12
um life and he remembered that a great
9:14
deal he mentions it a lot
9:17
but there are more than 5 million
9:19
Afghans in Kabul in the capital city
9:22
which is almost half the urban
9:25
population of the country and there are
9:28
36.6 million people in the entire
9:30
country
9:32
of Afghanistan so it is impossible to
9:35
help them all
9:38
it's a small Strife written not peaceful
9:41
mountainous country about the size of
9:43
Ontario and it will be powerfully
9:46
affected by drought and natural
9:49
disasters in the future due to climate
9:51
change and yet it has the same
9:53
approximate population size as Canada
9:59
so we can blame NATO officials for not
10:02
publicly protesting when President Biden
10:05
and the Secretary of State Anthony
10:08
blinken said that suddenly announced
10:10
that the withdrawal would be complete by
10:13
the anniversary of 9 11. we can blame
10:16
them for settling on that kind of time
10:20
or not conditions but time-based
10:23
approach maybe that was wrong
10:26
the date was arbitrarily chosen it was
10:30
just based on American needs not on
10:32
Afghan requirements so NATO allies
10:35
started withdrawing from rscm in by May
10:39
the 1st so here they are at NATO
10:41
headquarters in mid-april deciding
10:44
because the Americans wanted to pull out
10:46
the innate all the NATO allies said well
10:48
we'll all pull out then see how they're
10:49
all Consulting by Zoom this is during
10:51
covid
10:53
and they all decided to withdraw
10:58
so the Afghan Army is also at fault
11:01
because it was corrupt under trained
11:04
poorly equipped and once the Taliban
11:07
Warlords began to threaten the local
11:10
Warlords then the soldiers stripped off
11:13
their uniforms and some even joined the
11:16
Taliban raced away or just disappeared
11:19
into the rural areas
11:23
the Americans were firing from afar but
11:26
the concept of supporting the Afghan
11:28
military from outside the country
11:30
somehow using American bases and
11:32
Personnel was put forward but that's not
11:34
gonna that's not gonna work that's very
11:36
impractical it's not very well conceived
11:39
of
11:41
many citizens in Kabul did Rejoice
11:44
because Ashraf ghani
11:46
um he he had a very corrupt government
11:49
far removed from Power withdrawn from
11:51
the people unresponsive and so if he had
11:54
won the election again in September I
11:57
think that there would have been some
11:59
measures of dissonance and Revolution we
12:02
know now that ghani when he left in the
12:05
helicopters stole
12:07
169 million dollars in cash and he threw
12:11
49 million down on the tarmac for his
12:15
private guards to loot and take home so
12:18
the corruption was endemic meaning
12:19
widespread and the president needed to
12:22
resign a long time ago well before the
12:24
end of his eight-year mandate
12:28
the poor Afghans will probably spit on
12:32
ghani's image and curse him for
12:34
highlighting for hightailing it out of
12:36
the country on in his own planes with
12:39
about 200 AIDS who have since then
12:42
dispersed around the world some keeping
12:44
their titles others resigning all of
12:47
them perhaps lobbying for more money and
12:50
more armaments it's likely that there
12:52
will be a civil war in Afghanistan
12:55
that's decades long because there are
12:58
too many rifles too many weapons and the
13:01
air defense system could be taken over
13:03
by the Taliban
13:06
on future September 11th anniversaries
13:09
if any Western journalists are still
13:11
reporting from Afghanistan we can expect
13:14
to see American Equipment paraded
13:16
through the streets by Taliban fighters
13:18
even Biden's top security advisor
13:21
admitted that the U.S lost track of
13:25
billions of dollars of military
13:27
equipment that it had gifted the Afghan
13:30
military so it's all left there
13:33
intelligence assessments had predicted
13:36
that the Afghan National Army could hold
13:39
off the Taliban for one to two years but
13:42
they were totally wrong they were unable
13:44
not even to do it for a few weeks the
13:47
Afghan forces entirely failed to hold
13:50
off the Taliban and so we need to ask Dr
13:53
nemour this question is why were they so
13:56
deluded why did they leave so much
13:59
military equipment behind what were all
14:02
these errors and and you know they have
14:04
serious implications for the future
14:08
I am still sad to receive emails from
14:11
colleagues that I knew that I had met at
14:13
conferences begging me to help them one
14:16
email I met from a politician and a
14:19
peace researcher in Astana in Kazakhstan
14:23
he explained in broken English that he's
14:26
underground he does not know where his
14:28
family is and he does not know whether
14:30
he should stay underground to try to
14:32
escape or not
14:35
so quote from him but today I'm going
14:38
outside from Kabul City if God save my
14:40
life I will never forget this thanks
14:41
everyone who helped you about my case I
14:44
was trying to help his case and so on
14:49
so I did not hear from him since we'd
14:51
been in Kazakhstan I barely knew him but
14:53
he he wrote me last August that his life
14:56
was in danger and so on and as the
14:58
brother of a warlord his case had been
15:00
covered in the New York Times so they
15:02
had his name and he'd been trying to
15:04
negotiate peace instead of War so they
15:06
knew they will find out who he is he has
15:10
escaped though
15:12
so I knew he had learned if I know that
15:16
he's lent foreigners uh his vehicles and
15:19
guards so they can travel and try to
15:21
negotiate peace with the Taliban than
15:23
others know this too so he wasn't safe
15:26
and had to escape he did Escape
15:29
and this is um his kind of last
15:32
rejoinder I'm proud about that because
15:34
that was my duty to bring peace to my
15:35
country he tried to bring peace because
15:37
remember I'm the president of the
15:39
Canadian peace research Association so I
15:41
tried to help him but basically his
15:44
whole life was ripped asunder it was
15:45
ripped apart and I have been trying to
15:48
lobby for the Innocence since then okay
15:51
I think that's where we're at today and
15:53
thanks for listening
15:57
no obviously me just trying to add one
15:59
more slide but just that that they're
16:01
stalling
16:02
and that the Biden government
16:04
they haven't even tried to do any kind
16:07
of even showcase or to pretend that
16:09
they're doing a proactive diplomacy so
16:11
that leaves them open to criticisms by
16:13
the Trump
16:15
um elect people who run for the
16:18
Republicans that that the Biden
16:19
government hasn't done enough
16:27
this idea buffers zones I don't think it
16:30
can work I look through these slides
16:31
today and I thought well
16:33
could we do that and it's an idea that I
16:35
put forward at the end of this
16:37
presentation
16:40
um but really the problems are deeply
16:42
embedded favoritism cronianism a culture
16:46
of warlordism
16:49
maybe we could have zones of peace or
16:52
buffer zones we could have had that
16:54
maybe
16:55
a couple years ago this is the idea that
16:58
we can somehow protect sites whether
17:01
they're holy sites or Grant people Allah
17:04
Asylum
17:07
so to end to bring it all together we
17:10
need the United Nations a United Nations
17:12
emergency peace service we need more
17:14
trained peacekeepers to try to establish
17:16
buffer zones neutral zones demarcation
17:20
lines for example there was a zone of
17:22
peace freedom and neutrality in the
17:24
Philippines we need to think about how
17:27
we can provide local sanctuary in the
17:29
middle of violent conflict
17:32
end on a kind of more
17:34
um
17:36
I'm just going to take this phone
17:39
um
17:40
we can create safe havens communities of
17:43
Peace days of tranquility and
17:45
operational lifelines with the United
17:47
Nations hopefully
17:49
thank you for listening
