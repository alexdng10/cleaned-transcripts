00:00 welcome to the lesson on Afghanistan
00:02 

00:02 with a little bit on Kosovo Iraq and
00:05 

00:05 Mali but what we're really focusing on
00:07 

00:07 in this lesson is Canada and Afghanistan
00:10 

00:10 and the story I wanted to draw to your
00:12 

00:12 attention we don't know this here and
00:14 

00:14 what the we have no reports from
00:17 

00:17 Afghanistan anymore but certainly in
00:19 

00:19 2022 it was the least peaceful country
00:22 

00:22 in the world and it has been for a long
00:24 

00:24 time Canada's Elite Joint Task Force to
00:28 

00:28 which we call
00:29 

00:29 jtf2 went to Afghanistan in 2001 right
00:34 

00:34 after 9 11 followed by other Canadian
00:37 

00:37 soldiers mainly based in Kandahar I'll
00:39 

00:39 show you a map of where that is in a
00:41 

00:41 moment the Canadians joined Americans
00:44 

00:44 and British troops trying to topple the
00:47 

00:47 Taliban regime the Taliban regime is now
00:50 

00:50 back in power back then the goal was to
00:53 

00:53 eliminate terrorist operations in
00:55 

00:55 Afghanistan and establish schools
00:58 

00:58 particularly for women and institutions
01:00 

01:00 build a nation bent on creating a lot
01:04 

01:04 some sort of lasting peace that hope was
01:08 

01:08 not successful
01:09 

01:09 the Elite Force went in as I mentioned
01:13 

01:13 and they were followed by a lot of
01:16 

01:16 humanitarian organizations everyone from
01:19 

01:19 trainers
01:20 

01:20 peace support workers Canada spent a
01:23 

01:23 huge amount of money in terms of its Aid
01:25 

01:25 I even knew Ron Joyce who founded Tim
01:28 

01:29 Hortons he went to Afghanistan on
01:32 

01:32 Christmas day to serve coffee in the Tim
01:34 

01:34 Hortons that they made sure was
01:36 

01:36 established there in Canada
01:40 

01:40 so the first president Karzai was
01:43 

01:43 elected and a Democrat and they decided
01:47 

01:47 to authorize the UN decide to authorize
01:50 

01:50 NATO to lead what was called isaf the
01:54 

01:54 International Security assistance force
01:56 

01:56 in 2003 the United Nations simply did
01:60 

01:60 not have the capacity to do
02:03 

02:03 multi-dimensional peacekeeping
02:04 

02:04 operations in Afghanistan so they
02:07 

02:07 authorized isaf Canada initially
02:10 

02:10 contributed a 700 Canadian Forces
02:13 

02:13 members that were stationed in Kabul in
02:16 

02:16 the capital and in the surrounding area
02:18 

02:18 then in 2005 Canada went back to the
02:23 

02:23 Kandahar region which was considered to
02:25 

02:25 be a very difficult region to
02:27 

02:27 administrate and coinciding with the
02:30 

02:30 Resurgence in the Taliban activity
02:32 

02:32 and the numbers increased to
02:35 

02:35 approximately 2 300 they were engaged in
02:39 

02:39 large-scale offensive operations
02:40 

02:40 including operation Medusa which charged
02:43 

02:44 sage and the Minister of Defense himself
02:45 

02:45 participated in as a a soldier in the
02:48 

02:48 Canadian Forces
02:51 

02:51 as the war in Afghanistan became
02:54 

02:54 increasingly unpopular in Canada
02:56 

02:56 Canada's combat role ended in 2011 and
03:00 

03:00 they made it the decision to train the
03:02 

03:02 trainers the Department of Defense their
03:05 

03:05 focus shifted to training Afghanistan's
03:08 

03:08 Army and its police force but mainly its
03:12 

03:12 Army the RCMP also participated then
03:16 

03:16 Canada's participation was abruptly
03:18 

03:18 abandoned in 2014 under Prime Minister
03:21 

03:21 Stephen Harper this was due to a
03:24 

03:24 combination of pressure from domestic
03:27 

03:27 pressures reluctance to continue to
03:29 

03:29 contribute political expediency and wear
03:33 

03:33 weariness people were tired of
03:34 

03:34 contributing to the war the last of
03:37 

03:37 Canada's service members left in March
03:39 

03:39 2014 the United States left in August
03:42 

03:42 2021 seven years later so for more than
03:46 

03:46 13 years nearly 14 years the Canadian
03:49 

03:49 Forces operated and were very well
03:52 

03:52 equipped for a theater of war in
03:55 

03:55 Afghanistan
03:57 

03:57 the United States also operated in
03:59 

03:59 Afghanistan for more than 20 years
04:03 

04:03 so where is Kandahar you can see
04:05 

04:05 Kandahar in the South and Kabul the
04:08 

04:08 capital in the North not in the north
04:10 

04:10 but here closer to Pakistan closer to
04:13 

04:13 the mountains
04:17 

04:17 158 members of the Canadian Forces were
04:20 

04:20 killed serving in the Afghan war
04:23 

04:23 158
04:27 

04:27 let's talk about the kind of
04:28 

04:28 peacekeeping support operation that it
04:30 

04:30 was here you can see taken from NATO
04:34 

04:34 Doctrine the concept of increasing force
04:37 

04:37 and violence so Afghanistan was at this
04:42 

04:42 end of the scale of Peace enforcement
04:51 

04:51 the problems with this kind of robust
04:53 

04:53 peacekeeping are manifold there are many
04:57 

04:57 problems with it sure you can argue that
04:60 

04:60 allows troops freedom to maneuver and to
05:02 

05:02 prevent situations where they might be
05:04 

05:04 taken hostage the narrower argument is
05:07 

05:07 that it it helps peacekeepers to
05:10 

05:10 implement the Mandate it relies on
05:12 

05:12 robust forces which are also equipped
05:15 

05:15 and trained to use violence
05:18 

05:18 so that's one argument
05:20 

05:20 um but essentially it it was the broader
05:23 

05:23 interpretation is that the United
05:25 

05:26 Nations needed to signal to the Taliban
05:28 

05:29 and Isis their resolve to implement the
05:33 

05:33 U.N mandate and to deter threats
05:38 

05:38 why did the United States and NATO
05:40 

05:40 allies withdraw it was due to many
05:43 

05:43 factors ranging from the taliban's
05:45 

05:45 resiliency the emergence of Isis or isil
05:49 

05:49 and also significant territorial losses
05:52 

05:52 and casualties among Afghan National
05:55 

05:55 Security Forces so after the Canadian
05:58 

05:58 withdrawal from Kandahar Province the
06:01 

06:01 Taliban and Affiliated groups overran
06:04 

06:04 the districts and The Villages that
06:07 

06:07 Canadian Forces had secured and built
06:13 

06:13 so defense requirements and the need to
06:16 

06:17 spend social spending domestically
06:19 

06:19 necessitated withdrawal from Afghanistan
06:22 

06:22 by Canada and the United States so all
06:25 

06:26 these factors everything from climate
06:28 

06:28 change militarization nationalism
06:30 

06:30 poverty and the global war and terrorism
06:33 

06:33 meant that defense Industries continued
06:36 

06:36 to ever expand arms sales were
06:38 

06:38 increasing instead of decreasing
06:43 

06:43 and the arms exports to the Middle East
06:45 

06:45 kept increasing Canada became the
06:48 

06:48 world's second largest arms exporter to
06:50 

06:50 the Middle East after the United States
06:52 

06:52 so Canada leapfrogged over Britain
06:55 

06:55 France Germany and Russia into second
06:57 

06:57 place in 2016 was 3.44 billion in annual
07:03 

07:03 sales to the Middle East while Canadian
07:06 

07:06 government officials talked about
07:08 

07:08 respect for human rights Canada was
07:10 

07:11 ranked as the world's sixth largest
07:12 

07:12 weapons exporter overall
07:15 

07:15 that ranking did not count Canada's
07:18 

07:18 unreported arms trade with the United
07:20 

07:20 States under the defense production
07:23 

07:23 sharing agreement dipsa we will talk
07:25 

07:25 more about dipsell later this term when
07:27 

07:27 we talk about economic cooperation with
07:30 

07:30 the United States
07:32 

07:32 as U.N Secretary General ban ki-moon
07:36 

07:36 warned back then in 2016 the world is
07:39 

07:39 over armed and peace is underfunded
07:44 

07:44 even the pope who
07:47 

07:47 who of the
07:49 

07:49 Catholic leader of the leader of
07:52 

07:52 Catholics worldwide
07:54 

07:54 argued and you can read what he quote
07:56 

07:56 his quote there yourself in green
07:59 

07:59 basically he argued that we were
08:01 

08:01 spending too much on
08:03 

08:03 um on on
08:05 

08:05 helping or on the suffering of
08:08 

08:08 individuals the Canadian Prime Minister
08:10 

08:10 knew to the International Community was
08:13 

08:13 hailed around the world for his
08:15 

08:15 commitment to women's rights and lgbtq
08:18 

08:18 rights the U.S president Barack Obama
08:21 

08:21 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and he
08:23 

08:23 pledged in 2009 to abolish nuclear
08:27 

08:27 weapons yet nobody could Forge peace in
08:30 

08:30 Afghanistan it was very frustrating
08:33 

08:33 even Civil Society organizations such as
08:36 

08:36 the I'm the president of the Canadian
08:38 

08:38 peace research Association a hundred
08:41 

08:41 academics focused on peace the redo
08:44 

08:44 Institute project plausers hogwash
08:48 

08:48 Canada the UN Association the world
08:49 

08:50 Federalist movements all these ngos were
08:52 

08:53 being decimated by cutbacks and staffed
08:55 

08:55 mainly by volunteers what remained of
08:58 

08:58 any protest movement tended to focus on
09:01 

09:01 opposing particular weapon systems like
09:04 

09:04 the purchase of the new F-35 fighter
09:07 

09:07 jets and this and they were opposed to
09:10 

09:10 the sale of london-built light armored
09:12 

09:12 vehicles or Labs which we export to
09:15 

09:15 Saudi Arabia
09:17 

09:17 so
09:18 

09:18 um there was General frustration
09:22 

09:22 meanwhile Americans were also involved
09:25 

09:25 in
09:26 

09:26 spending more on Space defense on
09:28 

09:28 ballistic missile defense on pledging
09:30 

09:30 new b-61 bombers in Europe and on
09:33 

09:33 modernizing their nuclear weapons so
09:36 

09:36 while the Americans were spending more
09:39 

09:39 trying to defend NATO along a new
09:41 

09:41 Central front in Europe including Latvia
09:43 

09:43 the prime minister of Canada was
09:46 

09:46 promising to sell more labs to Saudi
09:48 

09:48 Arabia and to contribute 250 troops to
09:52 

09:52 lap to NATO's forces in Latvia so that's
09:55 

09:55 a symbolic tripwire force it is to deter
09:59 

09:59 the growing threat now in the wake of
10:02 

10:02 Ukraine we'll talk about this later
10:03 

10:03 there's many many more rapid reaction
10:06 

10:06 forces that will be capable they're not
10:09 

10:09 deployed there but they will be capable
10:11 

10:11 of Defending or deterring the growing
10:14 

10:14 threat from Russia
10:16 

10:16 the middle part is at the same time had
10:18 

10:18 to cut the United Nations annual
10:20 

10:20 peacekeeping budget and there's the UN
10:22 

10:22 General Assembly uh with the day at the
10:25 

10:25 front where the U.N Secretary General
10:28 

10:28 convenes and he had to reduce they can't
10:32 

10:32 even they don't even have enough money
10:33 

10:33 to run the lights
10:35 

10:35 um on the weekends
10:38 

10:38 so Canada I held a public consultation
10:41 

10:41 in 2016. I was part of that
10:44 

10:44 um I I mentioned before that I met with
10:46 

10:46 the defense minister my theme was that
10:49 

10:49 we should have peacekeeping training and
10:51 

10:51 that we should kick-start a U.N
10:53 

10:53 emergency Force we should re-establish
10:56 

10:56 the idea of a government-run Canadian
10:58 

10:58 peacekeeping Training Center
11:00 

11:00 so that was some of my ideas
11:04 

11:04 and that Harkens back to the first part
11:06 

11:06 of this module where I talked about the
11:09 

11:09 contribution of Lester B Pearson so um
11:11 

11:11 we we had argued for the establishment
11:15 

11:15 of what was called the Lester what came
11:17 

11:17 to be called the Lester B Pearson
11:19 

11:19 multinational peacekeeping Training
11:21 

11:21 Center Jeffrey Pearson gave me
11:22 

11:22 permission to use his father's name for
11:26 

11:26 the peacekeeping training center and it
11:28 

11:28 was established in the 1990s and then it
11:31 

11:31 was closed by the Harper government so
11:34 

11:34 it had originally it helped to train
11:36 

11:36 young interns and also Canadian Forces
11:39 

11:39 personnel and it helped to train
11:40 

11:40 peacekeepers from around the world but
11:42 

11:42 then it was closed
11:44 

11:44 so here's a picture of the main part of
11:46 

11:46 it at Cornwallis and I argued that we
11:50 

11:50 should re-establish it not necessarily
11:51 

11:51 in well not at Cornwallis anymore but in
11:54 

11:54 Kingston
11:55 

11:56 Ottawa with spokes across the country
11:57 

11:57 from Halifax to Vancouver and then this
12:00 

12:00 would allow us to train the RCMP the
12:03 

12:03 Canadian Forces and volunteer civilians
12:06 

12:06 foreign
12:07 

12:07 when we first proposed this our original
12:10 

12:10 proposal was to establish a Canadian and
12:12 

12:12 Multinational peacekeeping Training
12:14 

12:14 Center at a base that was slated to be
12:16 

12:16 closed in Nova Scotia and we managed to
12:19 

12:19 get three provincial parties and the
12:21 

12:21 premier of Nova Scotia to endorse and it
12:24 

12:24 took a lot of work though and Brian
12:26 

12:26 mulroney's government and also Kim
12:29 

12:29 Campbell's government rejected it but
12:31 

12:31 then finally prime minister Jean Preston
12:34 

12:34 announced that he would convert the base
12:37 

12:37 in Nova Scotia to a peacekeeping
12:39 

12:39 training center and lots of people
12:40 

12:40 trained there including NATO personnel
12:44 

12:44 it was called the Lester B Pearson a
12:46 

12:46 training center there's obviously many
12:48 

12:48 things are named after uh Pearson
12:50 

12:50 including the airport and schools and so
12:53 

12:53 on but we were very happy that in 1994
12:57 

12:57 it was established and it helped also in
13:00 

13:00 it in terms of NATO's partnership for
13:02 

13:02 peace because they trained countries
13:05 

13:05 there under Canada's mtap military
13:07 

13:07 training assistance program I use a lot
13:10 

13:10 of acronyms because I'm accustomed to
13:11 

13:11 them and so it's sort of strange
13:13 

13:13 sometimes when I have to go back to the
13:14 

13:14 original word but anyway from the start
13:17 

13:17 the Pearson Center that's what we called
13:19 

13:19 it was plagued by cost cutting and poor
13:22 

13:22 management and infighting about the
13:24 

13:24 remote location in Nova Scotia there's
13:27 

13:27 the queen
13:29 

13:29 so the future is I think different and
13:33 

13:33 that's to move toward a U.N emergency
13:34 

13:34 peace service or unaps
13:37 

13:37 um I'm I might be having a zoom lecture
13:39 

13:39 on that uh by Dr Peter langel but that's
13:42 

13:42 the concept that was developed in the
13:44 

13:44 aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide
13:48 

13:48 and it was part of
13:50 

13:50 um our failed proposal to improve the
13:53 

13:53 United Nations rapid deployment capacity
13:56 

13:56 we did some stuff on rapid reaction but
13:59 

13:59 now the argument is that a new uneps
14:02 

14:02 would be inexpensive and small maybe it
14:05 

14:05 could be deployed in Ukraine but it
14:06 

14:06 would help to prevent armed conflict and
14:08 

14:08 it would stem atrocities like genocide
14:11 

14:11 from happening it would protect
14:13 

14:13 desperate civilians and it would help to
14:16 

14:16 start a more multi-dimensional
14:18 

14:18 peacekeeping operations
14:20 

14:20 uneps it's not in place yet
14:24 

14:24 so it would be it could be an emergency
14:27 

14:27 911 like 9-1-1 force that could be
14:30 

14:30 relied upon and a Canadian initiative
14:33 

14:33 would obviously complement our existing
14:35 

14:35 arrangements and reliable fast First
14:39 

14:39 Responders things that we have in the
14:42 

14:42 past extolled
14:44 

14:44 so here um Howard langel first proposed
14:48 

14:48 this as a way to bridge the commitment
14:50 

14:50 capacity Gap and the idea was it would
14:53 

14:53 complement existing arrangements and it
14:55 

14:55 could make as he put it a world of
14:57 

14:57 difference so he's written a lot of
14:59 

14:59 books and articles and reports and you
15:01 

15:01 can also hear his lectures online on
15:03 

15:03 this
15:06 

15:06 so I have
15:10 

15:10 having and the sustainable development
15:12 

15:12 goals at the United Nations and the
15:14 

15:14 government that would and the
15:15 

15:15 environment excuse me that would do more
15:17 

15:17 for North American Security than
15:19 

15:19 increases in military spending dozens of
15:22 

15:22 countries have peacekeeping centers now
15:24 

15:24 and training programs and it's time for
15:27 

15:27 the peace the PPC the Pearson
15:30 

15:30 peacekeeping Center to be reopened under
15:32 

15:32 the auspices of the Canadian government
15:34 

15:34 not privatized so a federal government
15:37 

15:37 center would be part of our peacekeeping
15:40 

15:40 institutions
15:43 

15:43 now to return to what happened Donald
15:46 

15:46 Trump blasted the NATO allies for not
15:48 

15:48 spending enough fund on defense and on
15:50 

15:50 his first foreign trip he pressured NATO
15:52 

15:52 members to increase their defense
15:54 

15:54 spending to two percent of their GDP the
15:57 

15:57 defense minister back then uh Peter
15:59 

15:59 McKay started in a conversation with me
16:03 

16:03 that our our commitment to Afghanistan
16:06 

16:06 gave us a more credible voice in NATO's
16:09 

16:09 corridors but then at what price because
16:11 

16:11 we lost so many Canadian Forces
16:14 

16:14 Personnel even at the height when we
16:15 

16:15 were around three thousand
16:18 

16:18 number of Canadians that were killed in
16:21 

16:21 Afghanistan was 158 and according to a
16:24 

16:24 recent investigation 54 Canadian
16:27 

16:27 soldiers committed suicide after the war
16:31 

16:31 um
16:34 

16:34 so what do we need to do combat capable
16:36 

16:36 enforcement so you know what those words
16:38 

16:38 mean now you've listened to these
16:40 

16:40 lectures needs to be combined with
16:42 

16:42 peacekeeping training on the battlefield
16:44 

16:44 and what we're arguing then is that
16:46 

16:46 volunteers might acquire the skills and
16:49 

16:49 values along with professional trained
16:51 

16:51 forces to do peace enforcement but more
16:54 

16:54 importantly to do peacemaking so we need
16:56 

16:56 to combine combat capable enforcement
16:59 

16:59 with peacekeeping training at a training
17:02 

17:02 site close to Ottawa and also on the
17:04 

17:04 battlefield and online that's the new
17:06 

17:06 type of learning
17:09 

17:09 as I mentioned the PPC was closed by the
17:12 

17:12 Hartford government and eventually well
17:14 

17:14 first it was moved to Kingston and then
17:16 

17:16 they changed it and so on and I don't
17:18 

17:18 need to go on about it but it was really
17:19 

17:19 the problem with the rural location in
17:22 

17:22 the remote part of Nova Scotia too far
17:25 

17:25 from the Halifax Airport too far from
17:28 

17:28 the big city and diplomats like to be in
17:31 

17:31 in New York City they like for their
17:33 

17:33 Partners to go shopping and so on and so
17:36 

17:36 it's really hard to attract people to go
17:39 

17:39 to rural Canada and after and struggled
17:42 

17:42 for many years it was closed down by the
17:45 

17:45 Harper government
17:47 

17:47 so we have argued for a rapid reaction
17:50 

17:50 capability for the UN and we did this
17:52 

17:52 study back in 1995 there's Stefan Dion
17:55 

17:55 who was
17:56 

17:56 trying to become the prime minister of
17:58 

17:59 Canada with hard decision and so on and
18:00 

18:00 Jean critian whom I've met and had lunch
18:03 

18:03 with and so on very interesting people
18:05 

18:05 we all were trying to forge that that
18:08 

18:08 tradition
18:11 

18:11 where would it be a U.N standing rapid
18:14 

18:14 deployment Mission headquarters would be
18:16 

18:16 set up
18:17 

18:17 um where would it be I'm not sure at
18:20 

18:20 this point
18:22 

18:22 so if we train the trainers and we
18:25 

18:25 support security sector reform SSR in
18:28 

18:28 Afghanistan does that and and we
18:31 

18:31 re-establish the creatures and
18:32 

18:32 peacekeeping training soldiers and so on
18:34 

18:34 I think this would burnish our country's
18:36 

18:36 uh peacekeeping record burnish means
18:39 

18:39 improve it
18:47 

18:47 okay so now I need to talk about isaf
18:49 

18:49 which was the nato-led force recall it
18:52 

18:52 that way back in 2005 Canada went back
18:55 

18:55 to the Kandahar region and we took part
18:58 

18:58 in large-scale offenses like uh
19:00 

19:00 operation at Medusa I mentioned before
19:02 

19:02 so the number of forces increased
19:05 

19:05 gradually to approximately 3 000
19:08 

19:08 Personnel on a rotating basis every six
19:10 

19:10 months so this means that many Canadian
19:13 

19:13 Forces went to Afghanistan as part of a
19:15 

19:15 professional Army what happened to them
19:20 

19:20 the um problem of suicide as as we've
19:23 

19:23 seen has has been extremely difficult
19:25 

19:25 for uh military personnel and civilians
19:28 

19:28 and the war in Afghanistan became more
19:31 

19:31 increasingly unpopular partly because of
19:33 

19:33 this problem with with suicide and with
19:36 

19:36 Peach and with with with trauma
19:39 

19:39 operation attention was the Canadian
19:41 

19:41 contribution to the training mission in
19:43 

19:43 Afghanistan and you can see there that
19:46 

19:46 we were training the Air Force and
19:48 

19:48 police and many Canadians went to
19:51 

19:51 Afghanistan to help build schools
19:55 

19:55 the Taliban was extremely resilient and
19:58 

19:58 as the PhD each candidate nasaki nampour
19:60 

20:00 whom I mentioned who had been the senior
20:03 

20:03 security advisor to Afghan president
20:05 

20:05 Karzai he then after his graduation with
20:09 

20:09 a PhD became the senior security advisor
20:12 

20:12 to the current Minister of Defense under
20:14 

20:14 President Ashraf Dani in Afghanistan so
20:18 

20:18 we both reported and wrote a lot that
20:20 

20:20 after Canada withdrew from Kandahar the
20:23 

20:23 Taliban and Affiliated groups like Isis
20:26 

20:26 overran the districts and Villages that
20:29 

20:29 Canadian Forces had secured and rebuilt
20:31 

20:31 for example in the panjawi district it
20:34 

20:34 was common to see schools that were
20:36 

20:36 Canadian taxpayer-funded projects being
20:39 

20:39 operated as madrasas as colleges for
20:42 

20:42 Islamic instruction administered by the
20:44 

20:44 Taliban
20:46 

20:46 so we I'm pointing to the taliban's
20:49 

20:49 resist resiliency and the emergence of
20:52 

20:52 Isis or isil
20:54 

20:54 the re the devastated country of
20:57 

20:57 Afghanistan like any theater of war
20:59 

20:59 suffered greatly from terrorist attacks
21:01 

21:01 and there have been so many of them one
21:03 

21:03 of the worst terrorist attacks in
21:05 

21:05 Downtown kabul's City Center in 2017 was
21:10 

21:10 um 150 the death toll was 150 people so
21:14 

21:14 it was very hard for us to counsel or
21:17 

21:17 suggest recommitment to that country
21:19 

21:19 because we're sitting there in the safe
21:22 

21:22 Ivory Tower of academe saying go and
21:25 

21:25 sacrifice more people but at the same
21:28 

21:28 time the Trudeau government announced
21:30 

21:30 its plans to seek a seat on the U.N
21:33 

21:33 security Council in 2021 and this would
21:36 

21:36 have been a role that would have come
21:37 

21:38 with more than symbolic power at that
21:39 

21:39 time so the question was should Canada
21:42 

21:42 contribute and how in order to be voted
21:45 

21:45 in to get a U.N security Council seat
21:49 

21:49 so one of the ideas was that we needed
21:51 

21:51 to reverse our declining participation
21:53 

21:53 in peacekeeping and make a commitment
21:55 

21:55 whether it's to to train trainers or
21:58 

21:58 whether it's to mandate a whole new
21:59 

21:59 peacekeeping force in Ukraine we needed
22:02 

22:02 to realize that the Russian proposal for
22:05 

22:05 a peacekeeping mission the region would
22:07 

22:07 slow down the prospect of the U.N
22:09 

22:09 Mission and we need to look at that very
22:10 

22:10 cautiously so Canada was trying to get a
22:13 

22:13 higher peacekeeping profile in a very
22:15 

22:15 short time frame and it was too short we
22:18 

22:18 did not have enough time to get other
22:21 

22:21 countries to vote for Canada and they
22:23 

22:23 were also very
22:25 

22:25 disappointed with Canada's lower
22:27 

22:27 contribution to U.N peacekeeping
22:31 

22:31 if we return to Afghanistan rather than
22:34 

22:35 start a new in Ukraine how can we
22:37 

22:37 provide long-term stability it would
22:40 

22:40 have required the direct involvement of
22:42 

22:42 the Canadian military and the Foreign
22:44 

22:44 Service and the Foreign Service got
22:45 

22:45 tired of Afghanistan the Canadian
22:49 

22:49 military became disillusioned and in the
22:53 

22:53 final analysis Canada decided not to
22:55 

22:55 take the lead decided not to try to
22:57 

22:57 protect Afghanistan's nascent which
23:00 

23:00 means it's growing younger schools and
23:03 

23:03 institutions Canada decided not to
23:05 

23:05 re-engage with nato in leading
23:08 

23:08 Afghanistan towards security sector
23:10 

23:10 reform so we'll talk in future weeks
23:12 

23:12 about when we talk about the UN about
23:14 

23:14 the failed U.N security Council seat
23:18 

23:18 so if the defense minister had taken the
23:21 

23:21 initiative and sent more Canadian
23:23 

23:23 soldiers to train the
23:26 

23:26 Afghan forces we might not have been
23:29 

23:29 accused of dissipating abusing up 13
23:32 

23:32 years worth of taxpayers money billions
23:34 

23:34 of dollars but it's doubtful I think
23:36 

23:36 Canadian taxpayers moved on and they do
23:39 

23:39 not think about Afghanistan Much Anymore
23:42 

23:42 the Secretary General of NATO Yen
23:45 

23:45 stefenberg has visited Canada asking us
23:48 

23:48 to increase our defense spending on the
23:50 

23:50 Arctic and he wants to expand NATO into
23:53 

23:53 the Middle East and the Far East what he
23:55 

23:55 calls the Far East I prefer the term
23:57 

23:57 Asia is that a good idea and we'll talk
23:59 

23:59 about that in future weeks
24:02 

24:02 though Donald Trump may switch cores if
24:05 

24:05 he runs again and that the problem is he
24:07 

24:07 switched course many times he originally
24:09 

24:09 pledged to withdraw swiftly from
24:11 

24:11 Afghanistan then he signed off on plans
24:14 

24:14 to send 4 000 more U.S troops adding to
24:17 

24:17 their roughly 8 400 or 11 000 depending
24:21 

24:21 on how you count them that were already
24:23 

24:23 there then uh president Trump decided to
24:26 

24:26 draw down the forces and now he's
24:29 

24:29 arguing that unlike Biden he President
24:32 

24:32 Biden he would never have allowed the
24:34 

24:34 debacle in Afghanistan
24:38 

24:38 to to just describe what he did the
24:41 

24:41 Republican Senators voted
24:44 

24:44 um against Trump when he wanted to
24:46 

24:46 completely withdraw they argued that if
24:49 

24:49 they withdrew from Afghanistan and Syria
24:52 

24:52 that would risk losing hard-won gains a
24:55 

24:55 precipitous withdrawal could put at risk
24:58 

24:58 hard-won gains and the United States
25:01 

25:01 national security so initially they were
25:03 

25:03 opposed the Republican Senators
25:07 

25:07 then Trump announced in December 2018
25:11 

25:11 without consulting the NATO allies or
25:14 

25:14 any Regional partners he decided a day
25:17 

25:17 after his uh he decided to pull American
25:19 

25:19 military forces from Syria he suddenly
25:21 

25:21 ordered the start of a reduction of
25:24 

25:24 American forces in Afghanistan and he
25:26 

25:26 said that they would now reduce the
25:29 

25:29 level of troops by 7 000 which was a
25:32 

25:32 complete reversal of his deployment of 3
25:34 

25:34 000 more troops in September 2017.
25:40 

25:40 the U.S defense secretary became
25:43 

25:43 increasingly distressed and lambasted
25:45 

25:45 his boss's impulsiveness and experience
25:48 

25:48 in a widely circulated resignation
25:51 

25:51 letter which is amazing reading if you
25:53 

25:53 ever want to read it but Trump replaced
25:56 

25:56 the secretary they call him secretary we
25:58 

25:58 call them Minister of Defense they call
25:60 

25:60 them defense secretaries with Deputy
26:02 

26:02 Patrick Shanahan and because he had no
26:05 

26:05 military experience the acting defense
26:08 

26:08 secretary and the acting chief of staff
26:11 

26:11 there was a basically chaos
26:15 

26:15 the Republican Senators stalled again
26:18 

26:18 Trump's threat to send half of the 14
26:21 

26:21 000 U.S forces in Afghanistan home and
26:25 

26:25 they actually passed legislation that
26:27 

26:27 would ban uh president Trump from using
26:30 

26:30 federal funds to withdraw from NATO so
26:32 

26:32 they were trying to fight Donald Trump's
26:34 

26:34 withdrawal efforts
26:39 

26:39 and at the same time Donald Trump uh had
26:43 

26:43 uh authorized the U.S peace Envoy zalmie
26:48 

26:48 khalilzad so he was leading on behalf of
26:52 

26:52 the United States the peace discussions
26:56 

26:56 in Doha and he did try to he did reach a
27:01 

27:01 tentative peace agreement after 18 years
27:04 

27:04 of protacted war so that then the Trump
27:07 

27:07 Administration
27:08 

27:08 kind of back backtracked
27:11 

27:11 and by appointing Kelly is that to
27:14 

27:14 negotiate directly with the ban people
27:16 

27:16 were critical of this new negotiating
27:19 

27:19 strategy
27:21 

27:21 so the peace talks were held in Doha in
27:24 

27:24 Qatar and they went on for nearly a year
27:26 

27:26 you can see them meeting there around
27:28 

27:28 the table and finally in February 2020
27:32 

27:32 I remember that very well because it was
27:34 

27:34 actually in Doha in Qatar I'm not at
27:37 

27:37 those meetings obviously I was not
27:39 

27:39 invited but they agreed to adhere to a
27:41 

27:41 set of commitments first of all the
27:44 

27:44 Taliban promised not to allow the use of
27:47 

27:47 Afghan soil at all for for terrorists I
27:51 

27:51 don't know how they would enforce that
27:53 

27:53 but that's what they promised and as a
27:55 

27:55 result the United States said they would
27:57 

27:57 withdraw 5 000 of approximately 14 000
28:01 

28:01 troops over 20 over 20 weeks
28:06 

28:06 though the Taliban had sent this
28:07 

28:07 delegation of officials mainly the sons
28:09 

28:09 of the elders and that was interesting
28:13 

28:13 to watch the different Regional
28:15 

28:15 participants included representatives
28:18 

28:18 from different countries around the area
28:20 

28:20 so I was in Doha but I was not invited
28:23 

28:23 to the talks obviously not just because
28:25 

28:26 I'm a female but because I but I was
28:28 

28:28 there with sacking and poor who might
28:30 

28:30 tell you a little bit more about these
28:32 

28:32 talks
28:34 

28:34 the Taliban made a consistent List of
28:36 

28:36 Demands including they wanted the
28:38 

28:38 withdrawal of all foreign troops full
28:40 

28:40 implementation of Islamic law and
28:42 

28:42 customs and they wanted Afghanistan to
28:45 

28:45 revamp the entire Constitution and its
28:48 

28:48 sharing of power so that it did not
28:50 

28:50 conflict with the Islamic code so
28:52 

28:52 because their goals were religious and
28:54 

28:54 not political there was some kind of
28:57 

28:57 criticism that they were not in a hurry
28:59 

28:59 and they were stalling they were using
29:01 

29:01 stalling techniques
29:04 

29:04 finally conclude with some
29:07 

29:07 considerations preceding the actual
29:09 

29:09 withdrawal there was President Ashraf
29:12 

29:12 ghani who's pictured there was elected
29:14 

29:14 democratically in 2014. he knew that he
29:17 

29:17 was going into an election again and he
29:18 

29:18 would probably lose he was not popular
29:20 

29:20 and of course the Trump Administration
29:23 

29:23 was worried about elections too
29:27 

29:27 so the pressure for Swift withdrawal
29:29 

29:29 ratcheted up and finally they were
29:32 

29:32 trying to think about what what should
29:34 

29:34 we speedily withdraw from Afghanistan or
29:37 

29:37 not at that time there were 29 members
29:39 

29:39 in NATO and they were concerned about
29:42 

29:42 contributing non-combative professional
29:45 

29:45 forces they did not want to have
29:48 

29:48 non-combative professional forces
29:50 

29:50 because if the U.S Special Forces would
29:53 

29:53 go then there was the risk of being
29:55 

29:55 attacked in hostages so it would be too
29:57 

29:57 dangerous for the Germans and the
29:59 

29:59 Italians that were remaining so suddenly
30:02 

30:02 in April 2021 the United States and all
30:04 

30:04 the NATO allies 29 of them decided to
30:07 

30:07 withdraw by the anniversary of September
30:10 

30:10 11 2021 this was a bad decision that was
30:13 

30:13 not conditions based but that was based
30:16 

30:16 on time and so that was not a good idea
30:20 

30:20 finally the talks dragged on and the
30:23 

30:23 Congress was legislating and the Afghan
30:25 

30:25 government was embroiled in this
30:27 

30:27 conflict it wasn't popular it was at the
30:30 

30:30 same time looking at the territorial
30:32 

30:32 expansion of isil which some people call
30:34 

30:34 dayesh which is a colloquial term you
30:38 

30:38 can call it daesh into the Eastern
30:40 

30:40 provinces of Afghanistan so nobody was
30:42 

30:42 negotiating with isil the prospect was
30:45 

30:45 that daesh could take over the Taliban
30:47 

30:47 one territory and so on and they thought
30:50 

30:50 that this was all unacceptable
30:54 

30:54 so the count the the decision then was
30:57 

30:57 that uh the NATO countries would
31:00 

31:00 participate in NATO's Resolute support
31:03 

31:03 Mission RSM and that would need
31:06 

31:06 augmentation so rather than a quick
31:09 

31:09 withdrawal um they would try to do this
31:12 

31:12 training but if the U.S began to
31:16 

31:16 withdraw more troops it was unclear the
31:18 

31:18 NATO allies which ones could be counted
31:20 

31:20 upon to contribute more and so they were
31:22 

31:23 looking at a big list of them and saying
31:25 

31:25 well who who's going to provide more
31:26 

31:26 forces Canada wasn't going to the
31:28 

31:28 Canadian government was not going to
31:30 

31:30 contribute except for monetarily to uh
31:34 

31:34 to training the Afghan National Security
31:36 

31:36 Forces
31:39 

31:39 as well it became clear that the f
31:42 

31:42 Afghan government itself was not
31:44 

31:44 controlling its own districts and the
31:47 

31:47 cigar the special Inspector General for
31:49 

31:49 Afghan reconstruction in the United
31:51 

31:51 States reported that they were only
31:53 

31:53 controlling 55.5 percent of the
31:56 

31:56 country's districts which is extremely
31:58 

31:58 low level it's like saying half a
31:59 

31:59 community a little bit more than half of
32:01 

32:01 your country is controlled by the
32:03 

32:03 government so that that the Afghan
32:07 

32:07 National Security force was unable to
32:09 

32:09 hold on to the country's territory in
32:11 

32:11 the face of isil remember I talked to
32:14 

32:14 you about it being the isil is the
32:16 

32:16 wealthiest terrorist organization in
32:17 

32:17 human history and so even the Taliban
32:20 

32:20 could not combat this
32:24 

32:24 I've gone to Nato headquarters seven or
32:26 

32:26 eight times now since the 1990s and I
32:30 

32:30 went in 2018 and 2020 actually with saki
32:34 

32:34 nampour in 2018 and we wanted to meet
32:37 

32:38 with diplomats to discuss Afghanistan
32:40 

32:40 including oppositions to hopefully end
32:43 

32:43 the war so we met with different people
32:45 

32:45 including John Manza the NATO's
32:48 

32:48 assistant Secretary General in charge of
32:50 

32:50 all of NATO's operations Mark depaolo
32:53 

32:53 who was NATO's head of operations for
32:55 

32:55 Afghanistan and Iraq and Megan minion
32:58 

32:58 who's at that time was a former
33:01 

33:01 political advisor on uh Isa on the
33:05 

33:05 International Security assistance Force
33:07 

33:07 we also met with other diplomats in
33:10 

33:10 Ottawa and I just wanted to bring that
33:12 

33:12 up to show that there were Canadians who
33:14 

33:14 were really concerned
33:17 

33:17 of the they tended to argue that the
33:20 

33:20 Canadian Forces could take a greater
33:22 

33:23 role but we had contributed and we were
33:25 

33:25 contributing 250 troops to Latvia and we
33:29 

33:29 were contributing to training in Iraq so
33:31 

33:31 they tended to be pretty polite David
33:34 

33:34 Angel a former Palestinian of mine and
33:36 

33:36 so on pretty polite
33:39 

33:39 he's the Ambassador now to Nato David
33:41 

33:41 angel
33:43 

33:43 uh and so all these discussions though
33:45 

33:45 with the diplomats from Kabul from
33:48 

33:48 Afghanistan indicated that
33:51 

33:51 it would be very difficult to obtain an
33:53 

33:53 elusive piece in Afghanistan and somehow
33:55 

33:55 they would have to transition the
33:57 

33:57 Taliban to become a political party
33:59 

33:59 somehow to put down arms and share power
34:04 

34:04 I'm going to end with talking about
34:06 

34:06 women's rights because that was a very
34:07 

34:08 important reason that Canada became
34:09 

34:09 involved initially and obviously there
34:12 

34:12 were gains in terms of enshrining people
34:15 

34:15 men and women's constitutional rights
34:17 

34:17 and Liberties into the democratic system
34:20 

34:20 especially women's rights but many of
34:22 

34:22 those gains are now threatened and we
34:25 

34:25 will talk about that with Dr nemper I'm
34:27 

34:27 sure
34:28 

34:28 thank you for listening
