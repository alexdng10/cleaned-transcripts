hello everyone I'm very delighted to introduce to you Dr. Walter Dorne who is a wonderful professor at the Canadian Forces College and at the Royal Military College as I mentioned in my lecture he has appeared very often on CTV CBC you may have seen him or heard him on CBC Radio he is a noted world-renowned Peacekeeper and also he has a PhD from the University of Toronto in chemistry but also he knows a lot about chemical weapons he knows a lot about peacekeeping training and I'm delighted that he has come to speak to us about the evolution of international institutions thank you Walter for coming

Erica thank you so much I really appreciate uh being with you and with your students uh delighted to work with you and over the years and now to present and share um so I am going to speak about the evolution of international organization and that's because uh in our current day we see the international organizations are under siege you have US president Donald Trump who is withdrawn from the World Health Organization just after a major pandemic struck the Earth um you also have withdrawing from major UN institutions like the institution that helps Gazans at a time of their desperate need and we have uh all kinds of challenges even to the international law including trade law like the threat of trade tariffs uh which is can be challenged in the World Trade Organization and uh the United States is not even abiding by the World Trade Organization rulings so we have to look at you know how do how do we get to this place um where we are now and realize that this is actually a behavior that was typical of 100 to 200 years ago this is normal behavior of humanity and then we say well how did we create all these institutions that we take for granted and I'm going to uh do a quick historical overview to show the evolution of international organization

wow that's great okay great I uh I'll do so very much in the Simpson fashion with lots of uh lots of slides lots of eye candy to share so you can get that the visual dimension to go along with the um the content thank you Walter

you're very welcome okay so uh this is our planet planet Earth uh known at this particular image is called Blue Marble and we are floating in outer space and we seem to be a pretty amazing planet if you look at it from outer space all the astronauts seem to come back with with a different realization of our common humanity having seen the world as whole and from outer space and we realize that it's actually a beautiful planet with um a very thin atmosphere that's very vulnerable it's only 1% of the diameter of the earth and it's it's a very vulnerable atmosphere but we rely on it for our very existence now if you looked more carefully at it you see there are so many global challenges we have aggression and conflict weapons of mass destruction and mass murder we have diseases and climate uh huge climate changes climate change problems crime and terrorism human trafficking cyber threats and so much more so this peaceful planet is actually filled with with problems and you might under ask yourself how do the inhabitants of this planet deal with these problems what's what's the best that they're doing to be able to deal with these things and in order to to see that you'd have to look at how international organization has evolved and I'll start off with um the first cataclysmic uh world war it was the World War I and there was a clash of empires where countries felt that they could rule other areas of the earth and their colonies and they were challenging each other fighting over colonies and they uh came to a a major catastrophic war some 15 million killed in that war but afterwards was an idea that maybe we can do things better we don't have to have the the right of conquest or we we can't have governance without the consent of the of the governed and so this was the origin of international organization for peace and it came in the Paris peace conference of 1919 and it came out of the Woodro Wilson the US president who at the time thought the Europeans really have to do things differently if they're going to be able to survive and if the world is going to survive so he came up with 14 points the last of which which was to create a um he called it a general association of nations that must be formed under specific covenants with the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike so you see the notion there that you should have other people should have political independence and territorial integrity that you just can't go and acquire another territory because you want to um like Russia is doing now over Ukraine it's just it's of violation a blatant violation of international law has being developed but this principle is fairly new it's uh it's 100 plus a few years old and uh we really have to fight for it so in the 1919 Paris peace conference Woodro Wilson wanted to create this international organization but the British uh prime minister Lloyd George he wanted to maintain the British empire and uh the French premier Georges Clemenceau he wanted to have a UN uh sorry a League of Nations force that would be able to beat Germany if Germany attacked again and Wilson wanted a system based not on selfish national interest but on the broad international interest interest based on international ideals and we see this debate that between the narrow-minded nationalism and the broad-minded internationalism come again and again in human history and it's facing us once again now but of course we have a bigger better foundation on which to build in the great debate of 1919 Woodro Wilson thought there had to be not a balance of power but one powerful group of nations set off uh one single overwhelming powerful group of nations who shall be the trustee of the peace of the world so that nations have to come together in collective security not just collective defense against an enemy but against collective security against anyone who would violate international law but Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thought we should keep the United States out of the league and he wanted America to be much more choosy about when it intervened and not based on international law so the United States did stay out of the League of Nations for um the 15 years that the league existed um and of course World War II came and the United States was was shaken out of a stupor by the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and it joined the uh nations to fight against Germany and Japan and then realized well hey we have to do something better than what we did after the first world war we got to create a stronger League of Nations which they called the United Nations and so the uh properties and the principles of the league became incorporated into a better and stronger United Nations and the headquarters moved from Geneva to New York and the UN managed to do something league never did it achieved universality the um the 193 members of the UN represent pretty much all the people of the globe and so we you can see that there's hardly any more new nations to join um after South Sudan joined in 2011 and then Montenegro before that and Timor-Leste in um 2002 and this is a real achievement of bringing human beings together from all around the planet and what do they get together for well to maintain international peace and security to have equal rights and self-determination of peoples to solve international problems and harmonize the actions of nations it's all according to the UN Charter which also says that there's a sovereign equality of all its members it's like under the law in Canada one person doesn't have more legal rights than another that they have equality under the law and the UN Charter also asks in article 2 paragraph 4 that states refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the political independence or territorial integrity that's again coming right of Woodro Wilson's 14th point and they also agreed all those 193 nations agreed to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council the UN Charter also provides for peaceful settlement of disputes for negotiations inquiry mediation etc and referral to courts it also has this provision which is the enforcement provision um in chapter 7 of the UN Charter where nations and the UN can apply sanctions and actually use military force to back international law but it has a big caveat saying that nations uh have an inherent right of self-defense when they are under attack not if they're thinking an attack will come but if an armed attack occurs until the Security Council has taken actions there are other chapters um for regional organizations social and economic uh progress because nations realized that part of the problem of the rise of Nazi Germany and and imperial Japan was social and economic conditions after World War I so they realized we had to create an international organization that also dealt with that so the UN has a General Assembly a Security Council an Economic and Social Council a trusteeship council which doesn't exist anymore and an international court of justice as well as a Secretariat headed by a UN Secretary-General and a lot of the action the headquarters is in New York and the secretariat is this tall glass building on 1st Avenue and the Secretary-General has his office on the 38th floor Security Council meeting by the East River down on the in this picture here and the Economic and Social Council the other side and the General Assembly is that big building with the dome top that you see there so the General Assembly has all members all 193 each has five representatives and one country has one vote and you need a two-thirds majority to get a substantive decision and and a just a simple majority that is half majority half the votes in order to get a procedural motion passed resolution and they meet in September uh usually the heads of state come for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly they also have special sessions the Security Council in 1945 the member states um who were negotiating in San Francisco who were wanted to join and become part of this organization um they agreed very reluctantly that some nations in fact the most powerful nations at the time would have a seat on the Security Council now that's been pretty much frozen in time except for a switch from uh Kuomintang China to People's Republic of China but it's a um it's really a reflection of the world order of 1945 and unfortunately they didn't create a mechanism by which new states can automatically be part of the Security Council if they rise in power uh or there's other mechanisms for uh creating a Security Council permanent members that are more fair but there are 10 non-permanent members now and um these they come from different regions of the world Africa Asia Eastern Europe Western uh Europe and Latin America but there's lots of problems there's lots of politics being played in the Security Council and Russia has vetoed so many resolutions dealing with Ukraine I myself managed to get a little seat for at least a few seconds at the UN Security Council I took that picture in the the year that uh Canada was trying to get a seat on the Security Council unfortunately they they didn't but I did joking aside here's the Economic and Social Council which Canada does chair now Bob Rae our ambassador in the UN is is the chair of the ECOSOC and it also oversees the specialized agencies and the NGOs now you may try and guess these I don't have much time to to to uh allow you to time to think about what they are but the first is the International Civil Aviation Organization based in Montreal second one is International Labour Organization third is International Maritime Organization and you can look at the others and see if if any of them you can guess maybe the UNICEF one number six you can guess so here they are the International Telecommunication Union on the second level UNESCO United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNICEF children's organization Universal Postal Union World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization all important in their own areas for dealing with global problems which require global solutions more broadly we have an organization to deal with atomic energy human rights refugees and really importantly now the World Trade Organization so if nations are unfairly um imposing tariffs then the World Trade Organization has uh mechanisms to be able to do hearings on them and if nations really abide by the WTO we'd be able to solve them the UN has agencies funds and programs as well so NGOs have expanded very much at the UN I was just applying for an annual pass today for an NGO representing at the UN that's the Canadian Pugwash group there's also the judicial branch which is the International Court of Justice based in the Hague trusteeship council which no longer has a purpose because all of those territories have gained independence and the UN secretariat headed by a Secretary-General with a department of peace operations that has some 60,000 uniform personnel in different hotspots in the world the Secretaries-General have uh been from different parts of the world if you look at the list top it's um Trygve Lie then comes Sweden Trygve Lie from Norway then Dag Hammarskjöld from Sweden U Thant from Burma Kurt Waldheim from Austria Javier Pérez de Cuéllar from Peru Boutros Boutros-Ghali from Egypt Kofi Annan from Ghana Ban Ki-moon from South Korea and António Guterres from Portugal now what have what has the organization achieved I mean I talk about these uh long perspective centuries achievements well the UN has been around for over 75 years and what can you say it has achieved well number one decolonization if you look at the when the UN was created there were so many nations that were colonies and that decolonization process really sped up in the 1960s and here you can see the different years when the different nations got their independence we also had the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is used in many national constitutions uh including our own and it's uh something that's very widely accepted all around the world through specific covenants that come out of the uh UDHR Universal Declaration of Human Rights we also have the development of international law uh dealing with the sea through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea outer space treaty a whole bunch of disarmament treaties that are very important um and we have international criminal law which is just started to evolve after the Nuremberg trials in 1945-46 there was um a long pause where we didn't have an international criminal court until quite recently it created in 2002 and uh we have an international prosecutor who's actually now indicted the president of Russia and the prime minister of Israel it's a very bold moves to challenge power there are times when the Security Council played a major role like the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 where um the ambassador Adlai Stevenson would challenge the Russians and he actually showed pictures of missiles in order to prove to the world that Russia was clandestinely putting missiles into Cuba lots of in progress on peace peacemaking and peacekeeping so peacekeeping the first peacekeeping force was created at the initiative of Lester B Pearson the Canadian Secretary of State of the time in 1956 to solve the Suez Crisis and he managed to convince Dag Hammarskjöld that this was a good idea and then many more peacekeeping missions were created all around the world to deal with hot spots and to help resolve them so that's a way that international presence can be felt on the ground to have the eyes and ears of the UN there of course there have been difficult situations like Somalia Rwanda Bosnia and General Dallaire has uh described in great detail in his book "Shake Hands with the Devil" how he was facing those who were committing the genocide and killing some 800,000 people but with just 300 peacekeepers Dallaire was able to save 20,000 to 30,000 lives uh because they were they were showing a presence and the Genocidaires didn't want to do their slaughter in front of the the UN so there was still an example even though Rwanda is overall a failure of the of the international community but the UN was able to do amazing things with a very small force there and we have um the Bosnia situation and my friend Patrick Reckner was actually chained to a antenna as a human shield against NATO bombing but subsequently released and um and now Bosnia is at peace after several peace operations I remember when Patrick that happened to Patrick um because he was terribly uh how long has he chained to that poll while a few weeks well few weeks he was or days I can't remember but it was terrible for him and also I just want to emphasize how many troops did uh General Roméo Dallaire ask for only 500 troops and he got zero but you were saying that he he used 300 to prevent some of the genocide um so originally the UNAMIR force was 5,000 they never quite got it to their authorized strength um then he then the Secretary-General sent to the Security Council three options to reduce the force down to 300 or to increase it to 20,000 or to keep it as is and he said the current that as is is not working so the Security Council authorized the strength to go down to just 300 and um and or 250 I think it was and General Dallaire with almost 300 troops managed to save all those lives this is an example students of how important it is to to remember these numbers to know the facts you can see that Dr Dorne has an incredible memory for facts and even there you know recalling what happened in the past he can remember all this and that's important so that's why I will quiz you on a lot of these dates a lot of these times uh and also a lot of the pictures and keep that in mind for the multiple choice so I'm looking at it now and thinking well what can I do for multiple choice remembering that the students can remember pretty well everything that you say Walter so keep going this is an excellent lecture I I really really appreciate it sure we can make the PowerPoint available so anyone can look at it afterwards oh okay that would be great so this is a plaque at my college the Canadian Forces College here in Toronto which shows the names of those who died it was the graduating class of 99 who gave this to the college and it's those who served in peacekeeping operations and died in that cause um we have an expansion of peacekeeping so originally they were doing just military observers then they did buffer zones and and armed interposition interposed forces and then multi-dimensional where they're doing so many activities including police monitoring and bring police into the into the missions they did economic and social reconstruction and judicial work so just a tremendous amount of of expansion of peacekeeping tasks and here is a graph since 1991 of the number of peacekeepers uniform peacekeepers that is military and police deployed to the field and in the cold war is typically around 10,000 then it went to 80,000 then in the new century it really expanded to get to 108,000 and now since Trump was elected the first time it started to go down you see it's down now to around uh well 60 or 70,000 um uniform personnel and then the UN has used enforcement sanctions many times during the Cold War only twice in Rhodesia and South Africa but then afterwards many times and they used military enforcement action for the first time an international organization used force in Korea in 1950 to repel aggression big step forward for humanity now I have to also there you have Afghanistan 1999 till now see 1999 Afghanistan for sanctions present those are the sanctions yeah okay yeah yeah thank you going on to other areas of progress there's a huge achievement of humanity bringing uh hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and actually even though humanity has grown from six billion at the turn of this uh millennium to currently 8 billion there's actually fewer people who are desperately poor um so that's really a testament to the effectiveness of our global aid strategies and it's very unfortunate that uh president Trump has cut off the funding and is firing the employees of the largest aid organization in the world the USAID which is Agency for International Development um also eradication we actually took a disease and took it off of the earth so that it it could no longer bother humanity again and we'd like to do this with other things like polio but there's still a difficulties of completely eradicating that so going to uh to a conclusion we have a huge humanitarian challenges in different parts of the world today um there's a huge need for international organization to get involved for peacekeeping forces and for humanitarian law IHL International humanitarian law to apply to these areas so we can get proper conduct of military and um non-military forces but in the UN we see that it's not able to act as a world government um it it there's still these competing tendencies between sovereignty and the international rules and norms that there's a unilateralism like the US unilateralism up today versus collective action working together for a better world and that a lot of states put all the emphasis on their rights under international law but don't put any emphasis on their obligations and that's like Canada we contribute only 22 uh military personnel to UN peacekeeping right now when our our average um for the during the Cold War was 1,000 deployed and then there's a last principle of power versus uh principle that is that uh so many nations really spend their time uh thinking about power and the realpolitik and realism they don't think about principle or values or the international rules so they uh we have this huge challenge it's true that most nations abide by most laws most of the time but the outliers are so uh egregious and so obvious that it makes the news every day when these kind of violations of international law happen so these challenges that I was mentioning at the beginning they are global problems whether when one nation is attacked by another it's a problem for all of us because there it's like uh when one person is murdered uh it's a problem for all of us and we have to create the international mechanisms to deal with that just as we do at the national level we have police to investigate murders we need it the same thing to be done at the international level and all of these areas require strong international organizations so the mantra here is that global problems require global solutions and fortunately we have something to build on the UN has saved the world so many times uh from full-blown disasters and conflicts and uh otherwise we could very well have seen World War III but we have been able to keep this precious planet at least in some semblance of condition so most of us can live peacefully most of the time and that's us again on planet Earth as we try and make this a better place on which we can all inhabit in peace and uh under the rule of law thank you very much

well thank you Walter uh Dr Dorne that is a wonderful lecture that is uh very concise to think but also you covered a great deal of information and material and I would love to have a an actual live Q&A but we're at actually 27 minutes so we're a little over due to my enthusiasm for the points that you're making and I want to thank you I want to thank the people that are behind you Roméo Dallaire and I see you have a picture you have a drone and you have UN operations and we're in your actual office thank you so much for coming today and for talking to so many thousand hundreds of students including in future years I hope that you'll be uh I will show this again and again so thank you so much Walter uh Dr Dorne and uh good luck with everything that you're doing I'm going to stop the recording now if you don't mind

please thank you
