# Lesson 6B: Welcome to Global Governance

Today, nowhere is leadership needed more than at the United Nations — not just at the UN General Assembly, which is a talk shop for resolutions as we learned last week, but rather at the UN Security Council, pictured here. That's where global security concerns are hotly debated.

## Trump's Gaza Proposal and International Law

A Gaza takeover would violate international law according to experts — not just according to me.

President Trump has declared that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip, permanently transfer its entire 2.1 million population to Egypt and Jordan (the neighboring countries), and redevelop it into what he calls the "Riviera of the Middle East." "Riviera" refers to a kind of resort along a river, with hotels presumably.

That proposal, which Trump unveiled during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — often called "Bibi," his nickname, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Israel, pictured here — would unquestionably be a severe violation of international law. It looks like they agreed that Bibi was not taken by surprise, because Israeli soldiers are already being ordered to clear the land and forcibly push people out, though we're not entirely sure yet.

Forcible deportation — when you forcibly deport rather than attract people through voluntary immigration — or the forced transfer of a civilian population is a violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime, and it is a crime against humanity.

The international prohibition against forced deportations of civilians has been part of the law of war since the Lieber Code, a set of rules on the conduct of hostilities first promulgated by Union forces during the U.S. Civil War. The image here shows diplomats signing the Geneva Conventions after World War II and the Nuremberg trials. These norms have been in place since World War II — and arguably before that.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists forcible population transfers as both a war crime and a crime against humanity. If the displacement is focused, as it is here, on a particular group based on their ethnic, religious, or national identity, then it also constitutes persecution — an additional crime.

Palestine is an observer to the UN General Assembly and is an actual state party to the International Criminal Court, so that court has jurisdiction over crimes committed within Gaza, even if committed by citizens of the United States, which is not a member of the court. The ICC is an organ of the United Nations situated in The Hague, Europe.

When Trump was asked how much of Gaza's population he wanted to move, he said, "All of them," adding, "I would think they would be thrilled." When pressed by a journalist on whether he would force them to go even if they did not want to, Trump said, "I don't think they're going to tell me no."

I'm sure most of you saw that press conference. I know a lot of my students have written to me — including students from two or three years ago — and I want to mention: you can still email me after you graduate. I'm always happy to hear from you.

Professor Simpson reminds all of you that this forcible deportation would be a straightforward war crime. To advocate this scale of coercion and forced removal would make this a crime against humanity.

## The United Nations and Palestinian Statehood

The United Nations recognized Palestine as a permanent Observer State — not a full recognized state party — and 146 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state, though the United States does not.

The prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another state's territory is one of the most foundational principles of the post-Westphalian era. It is a principle not just of international law, but one the entire world recognized when Russia invaded Ukraine — that annexation could not be abided.

States — and you can quote me — cannot conquer someone else's territory. If a state violates that rule, as in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the response must be widespread condemnation. Aggression, which the ICC defines as a state using force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, is also a crime. So I am talking about crimes here.

President Trump continues to seem unconcerned with how his proposal might be viewed by the global institutions that underpin the international legal system.

## Trump's Actions Toward International Institutions

We will be speaking this week with a famous peacekeeper, Dr. Walter Dorn, on international institutions, and I'm sure he'll have a lot to say about President Trump's lack of concern for U.S. participation in those institutions.

We're seeing a flurry of announcements from President Trump. On February 5th, 2025, he signed an executive order calling for a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the United Nations, raising serious questions about the United States' commitment to that global institution. The newly inaugurated President has also already withdrawn the United States from the UN Human Rights Council. Trump is casually making policy proposals that propose to violate the absolute bedrock principles of international law.

We talked before about Russia in the Security Council, and we will be talking more about Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Ukraine as well — but let's move on.

## Will the UN Security Council Take Action?

Will the UN Security Council take action? We know that leaders like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — pictured here, look how young he is — have condemned Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide. He has already come out very strongly and said that the possible U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip is intolerable.

In 2020, Canada competed with Norway and Ireland for an elected seat on the rotating UN Security Council. Norway and Ireland are both generous donors when it comes to international aid — they easily beat out Canada despite last-minute lobbying by the Canadian delegation.

I've shown you the picture of the UN Security Council chamber, which is located in the United States. We're going to see what happens. Could the United Nations even move? Could it move to Canada? That would be interesting.

## Canada's International Development Record

The former Liberal Prime Minister Lester Pearson originally set the agreed-upon standard of 0.7% of gross national product to be spent on development aid — a bar that nations were supposed to aspire to. He was one of what are called the "three wise men." When he proposed this back in the 1970s, only the Scandinavian countries, including Norway and Denmark, have actually reached and exceeded it. Ireland is far ahead of Canada.

President Trump has cut all U.S. aid, and that affects hundreds of aid organizations around the world right now. Millions of people who rely on U.S. aid to survive are being prevented from obtaining it. I've juxtaposed here two images: President Trump looking triumphant, and Lester B. Pearson — called by the international community one of the wise men — looking quite sad.

## Canada's Feminist Foreign Policy and the Security Council Bid

Canada's so-called feminist, intersectionalist international approach — though duly lauded — has not translated into meaningful development contributions. Our measure of international development has been lagging for decades. It is approximately 0.28% of gross national income. Even when Karina Gould was Minister of International Development, she was not able to bring it higher than that. That is really low.

Canadians share a global identity marked by international cooperation, multilateralism, and a commitment to global citizenship — and you are in my class here learning about Canada abroad. I also teach Global Diplomacy and a class called Global Violence.

Now, in those classes I did not cover this, but I want to spend a moment on the official secret vote among UN ambassadors that took place in June 2020. I happened to be in New York City at the time. Canada lost terribly. The UN General Assembly countries simply did not vote for Canada. The Canadians thought they were going to win — I was talking to them and they were saying, "Oh yeah, we're going to get in there." No way.

The media tended to contrast Canada's values with the current American leadership back then, and there was a notable divergence — which may become even more notable now.

In 2020, it proved not to be Canada's time. Even with feminist international leadership and a caring international reputation, we were not able to sit across the table from the United States, China, and Russia — the P5 powers — and speak up strongly for a better world that is surely listening now.

Will Canada serve on the UN Security Council soon? I do not think so, because recent contributions to peacekeeping are so low. Dr. Walter Dorn will surely address those low contributions, as he has been one of the foremost critics of Canada's peacekeeping record.

Prime Minister Trudeau, pictured in the House of Commons on June 18th, 2020, said the Liberal government knew Canada was behind its competitors when it announced its intention to run for a seat, but hoped it could make up the difference during the campaign. This sounds like the same refrain all the time. I was there during their $50 million campaign — I didn't take any money, but I was there for different reasons — and it was clear: Canada was too late. Our peacekeeping reputation was seen as poor by many countries in the UN General Assembly. Dr. Dorn will speak to that, I'm sure.

## Guest Speaker: Dr. Walter Dorn

Pictured here is Dr. Walter Dorn — what I call a "media person" who regularly appears on CTV, CBC, and CBC Radio. He is a professor at the Royal Military College and the Canadian Forces College, an officer professional program. He has spoken to Canadians from hotspots like Nepal, East Timor, and various African countries that he has visited. He'll be speaking with us shortly.

My final slide shows him, I believe, on CBC discussing the first anniversary of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Dr. Dorn and I are often in the media together or separately, and we refer each other frequently.

I'm very happy he agreed to join us, even though he is extremely busy. His only stipulation is that he definitely wants students to be present. That will be challenging — my Zoom has a capacity limit, and I also cannot assign participation marks, since some of you are in China, Nepal, or in nursing with all-day practicums.

What I can offer is this: if you do come and ask a question, I will make careful note of it. If I ever end up writing a reference letter for you, that would be something I would love to mention — because asking a question of a guest speaker is genuinely difficult, and I am very aware of that.

I will be hosting him as soon as I can pin him down, and I look forward to your reaction. Thanks for listening.
