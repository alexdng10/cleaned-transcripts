lesson 6B welcome to lesson 6B Global governance today nowhere is leadership needed more than at the United Nations not just at the UN General Assembly which is a talk shop for Resolutions as we learned last week but rather at the UN Security Council pictured here that's where Global Security concerns are hotly debated and a Gaza takeover would violate international law according to experts not just according to president Trump has declared that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip permanently transfer its entire 2.1 million population 2.1 million people to Egypt and Jordan which are the neighboring countries and redevelop it into the what he calls the Riviera of the Middle East Riviera refers to kind of a resort along a river that with hotels presumably that proposal which Trump and unveiled during a press conference with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel we often call him for short nanu or BB some people call him his nickname BB the longest serving prime minister of Israel pictured here so uh uh TR uh president Trump and Netanyahu would this would this agreement would unquestionably be a severe violation of international law it looks like they agreed that uh uh BB was not taken by surprise that because they're already ordering um uh Israeli soldiers to clear the land and and uh it looks like forcefully um push people out but we're not sure yet so we're not sure forc deportation when you forcibly Deport not uh attract people to to immigration um or the transfer of a civilian population somehow is a violation of international humanitarian law it's a war crime and it is a crime against humanity so the international prohibition against forced deportations of civilians has been a part of the law of War since the Lieber Code which was a set of rules on the conduct of hostilities that was first promulgated by Union forces during the US Civil War I put a picture here of all these people diplomats signing uh after the World War II the um the Geneva conventions and after the Nuremberg trial so these uh this these Norms have been in place since World War II and actually arguably before that the Rome statute of the international criminal court lists forcible population transfers as both a war crime and a crime against humanity and if the displacement is focused as it is here on a particular group based on their ethnic religious or national identity then it is also uh called persecution which is an additional crime now Palestine as we spoke about is an observer to the uh to the United Nations General Assembly uh the court it it's a actual party to the international criminal court so that court has jurisdiction over those crimes if they take place within Gaza even if they are committed by citizens of the United States which is not a member of the court so the United States is not a member of the international Court pictured here which is an organ of the United Nations um and it's it's situated in the Hague in Europe when Trump was asked how much of that gaza's population he wanted to move he said all of them adding I would think they would be thrilled and when he was pressed by a journalist on whether he would force them to go even if they uh did not want to Trump said I don't think they're going to tell me no I'm sure most of you saw that press conference I know a lot of my students have written to me and students that I had last year or two years ago from third year I wanted to mention you can still email me and communicate with me once you graduate I'm always happy to hear from you and Professor Simpson me reminds all of you that this forcible uh deportation would be a straightforward War crime to Advocate this scale of coercion and forced removal would make this a crime against Humanity The United Nations recognized Palestine as a permanent Observer State it's not a a recognized State party and 146 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state but the United States does not recognize it the prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another State's territory is one of the most it's really one of the most foundational principles of the Westphalian era it and it's a principle not just of international law but when Russia invaded Ukraine everyone in the world recognized that that was that was um an annexation that could not be abided States and you can quote me cannot conquer someone else's territory if a state violates that rule as in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the response must be wide spread condemnation aggression which the international ICC the international criminal court defines as a state using Force against the sovereignty territorial Integrity or political independence of another state in any or in any other manner inconsistent with the charter of the United Nations is also a crime so I'm talking about crimes here president Trump continues to seem unconcerned with how his proposal might be viewed by the global institutions that underpin the international legal system and so we're talking with a a a famous a peacekeeper um this week uh Dr Walter Dorne on uh International institutions and I'm sure that he'll have a lot to say about President Trump's unconcern lack of concern for international institutions for the United States participating in those International institutions and we're seeing a flurry of announcements from president Trump on February 5th 2025 he signed an executive order calling for a general review of us funding and involvement in the United Nations and that raises questions about the United States commitment to a global institution the newly inaugurated President also has already withdrawn the United States from the UN Human Rights Council Trump is uh casually making policy proposals that propose to violate the absolute bedrock principles of international law so we talked before about Russia in the Security Council and we talked about the violation when I lectured with you and also um we will be talking more about not just Kosovo but and not just Afghanistan but we'll also be talking about Ukraine uh but let's move on and ask whether the UN Security Council will take action we know that leaders like the Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman pictured here look how young he is condemn Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide he has already come out very strongly and said that this action of of possibly taking over the Gaza Strip for the United States um is is is intolerable um in 2020 Canada competed with Norway and Ireland for a seat for elected seat on the rotating un Security Council now I've talked to you about the security Council could Canada take action on the security Council right now Norway and Ireland are on it they're are both generous donors when it comes to International Aid so they will they already beat out Canada easily despite last minute Lobby by the Canadian delegation I've showed you the picture of the un uh here the United Nations security Council location which is in the United States so we're going to see what happens cuz will the United Nations even maybe move out of um uh could it move to Canada that would be interesting uh the former liberal prime minister Lester Pearson originally set the agreed upon standard of 0.7% of gross national product uh to to be spent on on development that's what nations should aspire to now he was one of What's called the three wise men and when he proposed that back in the in the 1970s uh that was a bar that nations were supposed to Aspire to now the only countries that have have actually reached it are the Scandinavian countries including Norway and Denmark which are exceeding it and Ireland is far far ahead of Canada president Trump has cut all the US Aid and that affects hundreds of Aid organizations around the world right now millions of people who rely on us Aid to survive for all types of things are are being prevented from obtaining that Aid so that's I've I've juxtaposed that these two men here president Trump looking triumphant and Lester B. Pearson one of the wise men called by the International Community one of the wise men uh looking quite sad okay so I mentioned Canada's feminist International approach intersectionalist approach uh you can they call it a feminist approach but despite the it's duly lauded people always talk about how how wonderful it is and so on our measure of International Development is still and has been for decades lagging it's approximately it's less than 1% of our gross national income it is approximately 0.28% even though Karina Gould was the minister of International Development she was not able to bring it up um to higher than that's really low 0.28% okay so Canadian share a Global identity marked by International cooperation by the ideas multilateralism by concrete actions that cherish global citizenship and you're in um my class here learning about Canada abroad I also teach Global diplomacy and I teach a class called Global violence Global violence okay so in those classes I did not cover this but I just want to cover this for a minute about the official secret vote among un ambassadors which took place in June 2020 and I happened to be at New York City Canada lost terribly we could not gain ground the the UN General Assembly countries just simply just did not vote for Canada at all the Canadians thought they were going to get win you know I was talking to them oh yeah we're going to we're going to come back we're going to get in there no way know how so the media tended to contrast Canada's values with the current American leadership back then and it was clear there was this Divergent which which was quite notable and will probably maybe become more notable now we'll see in 2020 it proved not to be the time for Canada to be to become a member of the rotating un Security Council be even though we had a feminist International Leadership and a caring International reputation we were not able to sit across the table from the United States China and Russia from the P5 powers and speak up strongly for a better world a world that is surely listening now so will Canada serve on the UN Security Council soon I do not think so because the recent contributions to peacekeeping are so low and Dr Walter Dorne for sure will talk about those low contributions because he's been one of the foremost critics in Canada and the world of Canada's peacekeeping contribution Trudeau prime minister Trudeau pictured in the House of Commons on June 18th 2020 said the liberal government knew Canada was behind its competitors when it announced its intention to run for a seat but it was hoping it could make up the difference during the campaign this sounds like the same refrain all the time I was there during their $50 million campaign I didn't take any money but I was there for a different reason and Canada was too late it was clear our peacekeeping reputation was seen as poor by many many countries in the UN General Assembly and and Dr Dorne will talk to you about that I'm sure so here we have a picture of Walter Dorne he is a what I call a media person who goes on CTV CBC CBC radio and he's always on television so once you meet him he'll be lecturing in our class for the remainder for a short mini what I call Mini lecture he's a professor at the Royal Military College and at the Canadian Forces College it's a officers program and he's often spoken to Canadians from hotspots like Nepal and East Timor from um oh Africa different countries that he's been to so he'll talk to us and my final slide here is here he is I believe on CBC talking about the um first year anniversary of Russia's attack on Ukraine so Walter Dorne and I are often on the media together or separately or we refer each other and so on and that really helps as well and I'm really happy that he agreed even though he's extremely busy now the only stipulation he made is he definitely wants students to be there that's going to be difficult if I invite all of you to come my zoom Zoom will only take I also don't have any marks for participation and I can't do that because some of you can't participate because you're in China Nepal or you're in nursing and you have all day practitioner's practicum so I can't give a participation point but what I can extend to you is if you do come and you do ask a question then I will keep the careful note and if and if I do end up writing a reference letter for you then that would be something that I would definitely love you for because it's very hard to ask a question of a guest speaker and I'm very very aware of that so I will be hosting him as soon as I can pin him down and I look forward to your reaction thanks for listening
