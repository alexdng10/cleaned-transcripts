Really we need to stand up and be proud about this. Okay, so Canadians, we have mantras that have become the proved working language of the federal government pictured here. I used to live right where that Canadian flag is and I used to look out at the uh Parliament Hill, walk my dogs on the that's the it's the Gatineau Outaouais side, the the Hull side. Uh so anyway, the working language, the mantras is of the sustainable development goals. Until you go to the United Nations and until you go to Ottawa, you don't realize how embedded this SDGs are in their way of thinking. Okay. To end here this lecture, a digital movement map of Canadian organizations, NGOs and so on identifies almost 12,000 civil society groups that work on the SDGs. 12,000 different organizations in Canada that are working toward a resilient common future. That's an astounding number of people who are volunteering to work toward this vision. Uh so I do have a supplementary lecture in the supplementary lectures if you want to take a look at it on voluntary organizations that you could work for. I highly suggest volunteering even if it's for just a week during your February uh break. volunteer for an organization for free if you can and maybe they like you and as I explained in that lecture once show some commitment to their cause to their to their vision to their shared uh tasks they may actually uh find some money and hire you with a short-term summer position or a position over the next few years. Who knows? So work toward what you're passionate about and I'm certain that you will get and and obtain a really good career. Thank you for listening.
lesson 6B welcome to lesson 6B Global governance today nowhere is leadership needed more than at the United Nations not just at the UN General Assembly which is a talk shop for Resolutions as we learned last week but rather at the UN Security Council pictured here that's where Global Security concerns are hotly debated and a Gaza takeover would violate international law according to experts not just according to president Trump has declared that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip permanently transfer its entire 2.1 million population 2.1 million people to Egypt and Jordan which are the neighboring countries and redevelop it into the what he calls the Riviera of the Middle East Riviera refers to kind of a resort along a river that with hotels presumably that proposal which Trump and unveiled during a press conference with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel we often call him for short nanu or BB some people call him his nickname BB the longest serving prime minister of Israel pictured here so uh uh TR uh president Trump and Netanyahu would this would this agreement would unquestionably be a severe violation of international law it looks like they agreed that uh uh BB was not taken by surprise that because they're already ordering um uh Israeli soldiers to clear the land and and uh it looks like forcefully um push people out but we're not sure yet so we're not sure forc deportation when you forcibly Deport not uh attract people to to immigration um or the transfer of a civilian population somehow is a violation of international humanitarian law it's a war crime and it is a crime against humanity so the international prohibition against forced deportations of civilians has been a part of the law of War since the Lieber Code which was a set of rules on the conduct of hostilities that was first promulgated by Union forces during the US Civil War I put a picture here of all these people diplomats signing uh after the World War II the um the Geneva conventions and after the Nuremberg trial so these uh this these Norms have been in place since World War II and actually arguably before that the Rome statute of the international criminal court lists forcible population transfers as both a war crime and a crime against humanity and if the displacement is focused as it is here on a particular group based on their ethnic religious or national identity then it is also uh called persecution which is an additional crime now Palestine as we spoke about is an observer to the uh to the United Nations General Assembly uh the court it it's a actual party to the international criminal court so that court has jurisdiction over those crimes if they take place within Gaza even if they are committed by citizens of the United States which is not a member of the court so the United States is not a member of the international Court pictured here which is an organ of the United Nations um and it's it's situated in the Hague in Europe when Trump was asked how much of that gaza's population he wanted to move he said all of them adding I would think they would be thrilled and when he was pressed by a journalist on whether he would force them to go even if they uh did not want to Trump said I don't think they're going to tell me no I'm sure most of you saw that press conference I know a lot of my students have written to me and students that I had last year or two years ago from third year I wanted to mention you can still email me and communicate with me once you graduate I'm always happy to hear from you and Professor Simpson me reminds all of you that this forcible uh deportation would be a straightforward War crime to Advocate this scale of coercion and forced removal would make this a crime against Humanity The United Nations recognized Palestine as a permanent Observer State it's not a a recognized State party and 146 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state but the United States does not recognize it the prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another State's territory is one of the most it's really one of the most foundational principles of the Westphalian era it and it's a principle not just of international law but when Russia invaded Ukraine everyone in the world recognized that that was that was um an annexation that could not be abided States and you can quote me cannot conquer someone else's territory if a state violates that rule as in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine the response must be wide spread condemnation aggression which the international ICC the international criminal court defines as a state using Force against the sovereignty territorial Integrity or political independence of another state in any or in any other manner inconsistent with the charter of the United Nations is also a crime so I'm talking about crimes here president Trump continues to seem unconcerned with how his proposal might be viewed by the global institutions that underpin the international legal system and so we're talking with a a a famous a peacekeeper um this week uh Dr Walter Dorne on uh International institutions and I'm sure that he'll have a lot to say about President Trump's unconcern lack of concern for international institutions for the United States participating in those International institutions and we're seeing a flurry of announcements from president Trump on February 5th 2025 he signed an executive order calling for a general review of us funding and involvement in the United Nations and that raises questions about the United States commitment to a global institution the newly inaugurated President also has already withdrawn the United States from the UN Human Rights Council Trump is uh casually making policy proposals that propose to violate the absolute bedrock principles of international law so we talked before about Russia in the Security Council and we talked about the violation when I lectured with you and also um we will be talking more about not just Kosovo but and not just Afghanistan but we'll also be talking about Ukraine uh but let's move on and ask whether the UN Security Council will take action we know that leaders like the Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman pictured here look how young he is condemn Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide he has already come out very strongly and said that this action of of possibly taking over the Gaza Strip for the United States um is is is intolerable um in 2020 Canada competed with Norway and Ireland for a seat for elected seat on the rotating un Security Council now I've talked to you about the security Council could Canada take action on the security Council right now Norway and Ireland are on it they're are both generous donors when it comes to International Aid so they will they already beat out Canada easily despite last minute Lobby by the Canadian delegation I've showed you the picture of the un uh here the United Nations security Council location which is in the United States so we're going to see what happens cuz will the United Nations even maybe move out of um uh could it move to Canada that would be interesting uh the former liberal prime minister Lester Pearson originally set the agreed upon standard of 0.7% of gross national product uh to to be spent on on development that's what nations should aspire to now he was one of What's called the three wise men and when he proposed that back in the in the 1970s uh that was a bar that nations were supposed to Aspire to now the only countries that have have actually reached it are the Scandinavian countries including Norway and Denmark which are exceeding it and Ireland is far far ahead of Canada president Trump has cut all the US Aid and that affects hundreds of Aid organizations around the world right now millions of people who rely on us Aid to survive for all types of things are are being prevented from obtaining that Aid so that's I've I've juxtaposed that these two men here president Trump looking triumphant and Lester B. Pearson one of the wise men called by the International Community one of the wise men uh looking quite sad okay so I mentioned Canada's feminist International approach intersectionalist approach uh you can they call it a feminist approach but despite the it's duly lauded people always talk about how how wonderful it is and so on our measure of International Development is still and has been for decades lagging it's approximately it's less than 1% of our gross national income it is approximately 0.28% even though Karina Gould was the minister of International Development she was not able to bring it up um to higher than that's really low 0.28% okay so Canadian share a Global identity marked by International cooperation by the ideas multilateralism by concrete actions that cherish global citizenship and you're in um my class here learning about Canada abroad I also teach Global diplomacy and I teach a class called Global violence Global violence okay so in those classes I did not cover this but I just want to cover this for a minute about the official secret vote among un ambassadors which took place in June 2020 and I happened to be at New York City Canada lost terribly we could not gain ground the the UN General Assembly countries just simply just did not vote for Canada at all the Canadians thought they were going to get win you know I was talking to them oh yeah we're going to we're going to come back we're going to get in there no way know how so the media tended to contrast Canada's values with the current American leadership back then and it was clear there was this Divergent which which was quite notable and will probably maybe become more notable now we'll see in 2020 it proved not to be the time for Canada to be to become a member of the rotating un Security Council be even though we had a feminist International Leadership and a caring International reputation we were not able to sit across the table from the United States China and Russia from the P5 powers and speak up strongly for a better world a world that is surely listening now so will Canada serve on the UN Security Council soon I do not think so because the recent contributions to peacekeeping are so low and Dr Walter Dorne for sure will talk about those low contributions because he's been one of the foremost critics in Canada and the world of Canada's peacekeeping contribution Trudeau prime minister Trudeau pictured in the House of Commons on June 18th 2020 said the liberal government knew Canada was behind its competitors when it announced its intention to run for a seat but it was hoping it could make up the difference during the campaign this sounds like the same refrain all the time I was there during their $50 million campaign I didn't take any money but I was there for a different reason and Canada was too late it was clear our peacekeeping reputation was seen as poor by many many countries in the UN General Assembly and and Dr Dorne will talk to you about that I'm sure so here we have a picture of Walter Dorne he is a what I call a media person who goes on CTV CBC CBC radio and he's always on television so once you meet him he'll be lecturing in our class for the remainder for a short mini what I call Mini lecture he's a professor at the Royal Military College and at the Canadian Forces College it's a officers program and he's often spoken to Canadians from hotspots like Nepal and East Timor from um oh Africa different countries that he's been to so he'll talk to us and my final slide here is here he is I believe on CBC talking about the um first year anniversary of Russia's attack on Ukraine so Walter Dorne and I are often on the media together or separately or we refer each other and so on and that really helps as well and I'm really happy that he agreed even though he's extremely busy now the only stipulation he made is he definitely wants students to be there that's going to be difficult if I invite all of you to come my zoom Zoom will only take I also don't have any marks for participation and I can't do that because some of you can't participate because you're in China Nepal or you're in nursing and you have all day practitioner's practicum so I can't give a participation point but what I can extend to you is if you do come and you do ask a question then I will keep the careful note and if and if I do end up writing a reference letter for you then that would be something that I would definitely love you for because it's very hard to ask a question of a guest speaker and I'm very very aware of that so I will be hosting him as soon as I can pin him down and I look forward to your reaction thanks for listening
# Transcript 6C

hello everyone I'm very delighted to introduce to you Dr. Walter Dorne who is a wonderful professor at the Canadian Forces College and at the Royal Military College as I mentioned in my lecture he has appeared very often on CTV CBC you may have seen him or heard him on CBC Radio he is a noted world-renowned Peacekeeper and also he has a PhD from the University of Toronto in chemistry but also he knows a lot about chemical weapons he knows a lot about peacekeeping training and I'm delighted that he has come to speak to us about the evolution of international institutions thank you Walter for coming

Erica thank you so much I really appreciate uh being with you and with your students uh delighted to work with you and over the years and now to present and share um so I am going to speak about the evolution of international organization and that's because uh in our current day we see the international organizations are under siege you have US president Donald Trump who is withdrawn from the World Health Organization just after a major pandemic struck the Earth um you also have withdrawing from major UN institutions like the institution that helps Gazans at a time of their desperate need and we have uh all kinds of challenges even to the international law including trade law like the threat of trade tariffs uh which is can be challenged in the World Trade Organization and uh the United States is not even abiding by the World Trade Organization rulings so we have to look at you know how do how do we get to this place um where we are now and realize that this is actually a behavior that was typical of 100 to 200 years ago this is normal behavior of humanity and then we say well how did we create all these institutions that we take for granted and I'm going to uh do a quick historical overview to show the evolution of international organization

wow that's great okay great I uh I'll do so very much in the Simpson fashion with lots of uh lots of slides lots of eye candy to share so you can get that the visual dimension to go along with the um the content thank you Walter

you're very welcome okay so uh this is our planet planet Earth uh known at this particular image is called Blue Marble and we are floating in outer space and we seem to be a pretty amazing planet if you look at it from outer space all the astronauts seem to come back with with a different realization of our common humanity having seen the world as whole and from outer space and we realize that it's actually a beautiful planet with um a very thin atmosphere that's very vulnerable it's only 1% of the diameter of the earth and it's it's a very vulnerable atmosphere but we rely on it for our very existence now if you looked more carefully at it you see there are so many global challenges we have aggression and conflict weapons of mass destruction and mass murder we have diseases and climate uh huge climate changes climate change problems crime and terrorism human trafficking cyber threats and so much more so this peaceful planet is actually filled with with problems and you might under ask yourself how do the inhabitants of this planet deal with these problems what's what's the best that they're doing to be able to deal with these things and in order to to see that you'd have to look at how international organization has evolved and I'll start off with um the first cataclysmic uh world war it was the World War I and there was a clash of empires where countries felt that they could rule other areas of the earth and their colonies and they were challenging each other fighting over colonies and they uh came to a a major catastrophic war some 15 million killed in that war but afterwards was an idea that maybe we can do things better we don't have to have the the right of conquest or we we can't have governance without the consent of the of the governed and so this was the origin of international organization for peace and it came in the Paris peace conference of 1919 and it came out of the Woodro Wilson the US president who at the time thought the Europeans really have to do things differently if they're going to be able to survive and if the world is going to survive so he came up with 14 points the last of which which was to create a um he called it a general association of nations that must be formed under specific covenants with the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike so you see the notion there that you should have other people should have political independence and territorial integrity that you just can't go and acquire another territory because you want to um like Russia is doing now over Ukraine it's just it's of violation a blatant violation of international law has being developed but this principle is fairly new it's uh it's 100 plus a few years old and uh we really have to fight for it so in the 1919 Paris peace conference Woodro Wilson wanted to create this international organization but the British uh prime minister Lloyd George he wanted to maintain the British empire and uh the French premier Georges Clemenceau he wanted to have a UN uh sorry a League of Nations force that would be able to beat Germany if Germany attacked again and Wilson wanted a system based not on selfish national interest but on the broad international interest interest based on international ideals and we see this debate that between the narrow-minded nationalism and the broad-minded internationalism come again and again in human history and it's facing us once again now but of course we have a bigger better foundation on which to build in the great debate of 1919 Woodro Wilson thought there had to be not a balance of power but one powerful group of nations set off uh one single overwhelming powerful group of nations who shall be the trustee of the peace of the world so that nations have to come together in collective security not just collective defense against an enemy but against collective security against anyone who would violate international law but Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee thought we should keep the United States out of the league and he wanted America to be much more choosy about when it intervened and not based on international law so the United States did stay out of the League of Nations for um the 15 years that the league existed um and of course World War II came and the United States was was shaken out of a stupor by the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and it joined the uh nations to fight against Germany and Japan and then realized well hey we have to do something better than what we did after the first world war we got to create a stronger League of Nations which they called the United Nations and so the uh properties and the principles of the league became incorporated into a better and stronger United Nations and the headquarters moved from Geneva to New York and the UN managed to do something league never did it achieved universality the um the 193 members of the UN represent pretty much all the people of the globe and so we you can see that there's hardly any more new nations to join um after South Sudan joined in 2011 and then Montenegro before that and Timor-Leste in um 2002 and this is a real achievement of bringing human beings together from all around the planet and what do they get together for well to maintain international peace and security to have equal rights and self-determination of peoples to solve international problems and harmonize the actions of nations it's all according to the UN Charter which also says that there's a sovereign equality of all its members it's like under the law in Canada one person doesn't have more legal rights than another that they have equality under the law and the UN Charter also asks in article 2 paragraph 4 that states refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the political independence or territorial integrity that's again coming right of Woodro Wilson's 14th point and they also agreed all those 193 nations agreed to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council the UN Charter also provides for peaceful settlement of disputes for negotiations inquiry mediation etc and referral to courts it also has this provision which is the enforcement provision um in chapter 7 of the UN Charter where nations and the UN can apply sanctions and actually use military force to back international law but it has a big caveat saying that nations uh have an inherent right of self-defense when they are under attack not if they're thinking an attack will come but if an armed attack occurs until the Security Council has taken actions there are other chapters um for regional organizations social and economic uh progress because nations realized that part of the problem of the rise of Nazi Germany and and imperial Japan was social and economic conditions after World War I so they realized we had to create an international organization that also dealt with that so the UN has a General Assembly a Security Council an Economic and Social Council a trusteeship council which doesn't exist anymore and an international court of justice as well as a Secretariat headed by a UN Secretary-General and a lot of the action the headquarters is in New York and the secretariat is this tall glass building on 1st Avenue and the Secretary-General has his office on the 38th floor Security Council meeting by the East River down on the in this picture here and the Economic and Social Council the other side and the General Assembly is that big building with the dome top that you see there so the General Assembly has all members all 193 each has five representatives and one country has one vote and you need a two-thirds majority to get a substantive decision and and a just a simple majority that is half majority half the votes in order to get a procedural motion passed resolution and they meet in September uh usually the heads of state come for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly they also have special sessions the Security Council in 1945 the member states um who were negotiating in San Francisco who were wanted to join and become part of this organization um they agreed very reluctantly that some nations in fact the most powerful nations at the time would have a seat on the Security Council now that's been pretty much frozen in time except for a switch from uh Kuomintang China to People's Republic of China but it's a um it's really a reflection of the world order of 1945 and unfortunately they didn't create a mechanism by which new states can automatically be part of the Security Council if they rise in power uh or there's other mechanisms for uh creating a Security Council permanent members that are more fair but there are 10 non-permanent members now and um these they come from different regions of the world Africa Asia Eastern Europe Western uh Europe and Latin America but there's lots of problems there's lots of politics being played in the Security Council and Russia has vetoed so many resolutions dealing with Ukraine I myself managed to get a little seat for at least a few seconds at the UN Security Council I took that picture in the the year that uh Canada was trying to get a seat on the Security Council unfortunately they they didn't but I did joking aside here's the Economic and Social Council which Canada does chair now Bob Rae our ambassador in the UN is is the chair of the ECOSOC and it also oversees the specialized agencies and the NGOs now you may try and guess these I don't have much time to to to uh allow you to time to think about what they are but the first is the International Civil Aviation Organization based in Montreal second one is International Labour Organization third is International Maritime Organization and you can look at the others and see if if any of them you can guess maybe the UNICEF one number six you can guess so here they are the International Telecommunication Union on the second level UNESCO United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNICEF children's organization Universal Postal Union World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization all important in their own areas for dealing with global problems which require global solutions more broadly we have an organization to deal with atomic energy human rights refugees and really importantly now the World Trade Organization so if nations are unfairly um imposing tariffs then the World Trade Organization has uh mechanisms to be able to do hearings on them and if nations really abide by the WTO we'd be able to solve them the UN has agencies funds and programs as well so NGOs have expanded very much at the UN I was just applying for an annual pass today for an NGO representing at the UN that's the Canadian Pugwash group there's also the judicial branch which is the International Court of Justice based in the Hague trusteeship council which no longer has a purpose because all of those territories have gained independence and the UN secretariat headed by a Secretary-General with a department of peace operations that has some 60,000 uniform personnel in different hotspots in the world the Secretaries-General have uh been from different parts of the world if you look at the list top it's um Trygve Lie then comes Sweden Trygve Lie from Norway then Dag Hammarskjöld from Sweden U Thant from Burma Kurt Waldheim from Austria Javier Pérez de Cuéllar from Peru Boutros Boutros-Ghali from Egypt Kofi Annan from Ghana Ban Ki-moon from South Korea and António Guterres from Portugal now what have what has the organization achieved I mean I talk about these uh long perspective centuries achievements well the UN has been around for over 75 years and what can you say it has achieved well number one decolonization if you look at the when the UN was created there were so many nations that were colonies and that decolonization process really sped up in the 1960s and here you can see the different years when the different nations got their independence we also had the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is used in many national constitutions uh including our own and it's uh something that's very widely accepted all around the world through specific covenants that come out of the uh UDHR Universal Declaration of Human Rights we also have the development of international law uh dealing with the sea through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea outer space treaty a whole bunch of disarmament treaties that are very important um and we have international criminal law which is just started to evolve after the Nuremberg trials in 1945-46 there was um a long pause where we didn't have an international criminal court until quite recently it created in 2002 and uh we have an international prosecutor who's actually now indicted the president of Russia and the prime minister of Israel it's a very bold moves to challenge power there are times when the Security Council played a major role like the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 where um the ambassador Adlai Stevenson would challenge the Russians and he actually showed pictures of missiles in order to prove to the world that Russia was clandestinely putting missiles into Cuba lots of in progress on peace peacemaking and peacekeeping so peacekeeping the first peacekeeping force was created at the initiative of Lester B Pearson the Canadian Secretary of State of the time in 1956 to solve the Suez Crisis and he managed to convince Dag Hammarskjöld that this was a good idea and then many more peacekeeping missions were created all around the world to deal with hot spots and to help resolve them so that's a way that international presence can be felt on the ground to have the eyes and ears of the UN there of course there have been difficult situations like Somalia Rwanda Bosnia and General Dallaire has uh described in great detail in his book "Shake Hands with the Devil" how he was facing those who were committing the genocide and killing some 800,000 people but with just 300 peacekeepers Dallaire was able to save 20,000 to 30,000 lives uh because they were they were showing a presence and the Genocidaires didn't want to do their slaughter in front of the the UN so there was still an example even though Rwanda is overall a failure of the of the international community but the UN was able to do amazing things with a very small force there and we have um the Bosnia situation and my friend Patrick Reckner was actually chained to a antenna as a human shield against NATO bombing but subsequently released and um and now Bosnia is at peace after several peace operations I remember when Patrick that happened to Patrick um because he was terribly uh how long has he chained to that poll while a few weeks well few weeks he was or days I can't remember but it was terrible for him and also I just want to emphasize how many troops did uh General Roméo Dallaire ask for only 500 troops and he got zero but you were saying that he he used 300 to prevent some of the genocide um so originally the UNAMIR force was 5,000 they never quite got it to their authorized strength um then he then the Secretary-General sent to the Security Council three options to reduce the force down to 300 or to increase it to 20,000 or to keep it as is and he said the current that as is is not working so the Security Council authorized the strength to go down to just 300 and um and or 250 I think it was and General Dallaire with almost 300 troops managed to save all those lives this is an example students of how important it is to to remember these numbers to know the facts you can see that Dr Dorne has an incredible memory for facts and even there you know recalling what happened in the past he can remember all this and that's important so that's why I will quiz you on a lot of these dates a lot of these times uh and also a lot of the pictures and keep that in mind for the multiple choice so I'm looking at it now and thinking well what can I do for multiple choice remembering that the students can remember pretty well everything that you say Walter so keep going this is an excellent lecture I I really really appreciate it sure we can make the PowerPoint available so anyone can look at it afterwards oh okay that would be great so this is a plaque at my college the Canadian Forces College here in Toronto which shows the names of those who died it was the graduating class of 99 who gave this to the college and it's those who served in peacekeeping operations and died in that cause um we have an expansion of peacekeeping so originally they were doing just military observers then they did buffer zones and and armed interposition interposed forces and then multi-dimensional where they're doing so many activities including police monitoring and bring police into the into the missions they did economic and social reconstruction and judicial work so just a tremendous amount of of expansion of peacekeeping tasks and here is a graph since 1991 of the number of peacekeepers uniform peacekeepers that is military and police deployed to the field and in the cold war is typically around 10,000 then it went to 80,000 then in the new century it really expanded to get to 108,000 and now since Trump was elected the first time it started to go down you see it's down now to around uh well 60 or 70,000 um uniform personnel and then the UN has used enforcement sanctions many times during the Cold War only twice in Rhodesia and South Africa but then afterwards many times and they used military enforcement action for the first time an international organization used force in Korea in 1950 to repel aggression big step forward for humanity now I have to also there you have Afghanistan 1999 till now see 1999 Afghanistan for sanctions present those are the sanctions yeah okay yeah yeah thank you going on to other areas of progress there's a huge achievement of humanity bringing uh hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and actually even though humanity has grown from six billion at the turn of this uh millennium to currently 8 billion there's actually fewer people who are desperately poor um so that's really a testament to the effectiveness of our global aid strategies and it's very unfortunate that uh president Trump has cut off the funding and is firing the employees of the largest aid organization in the world the USAID which is Agency for International Development um also eradication we actually took a disease and took it off of the earth so that it it could no longer bother humanity again and we'd like to do this with other things like polio but there's still a difficulties of completely eradicating that so going to uh to a conclusion we have a huge humanitarian challenges in different parts of the world today um there's a huge need for international organization to get involved for peacekeeping forces and for humanitarian law IHL International humanitarian law to apply to these areas so we can get proper conduct of military and um non-military forces but in the UN we see that it's not able to act as a world government um it it there's still these competing tendencies between sovereignty and the international rules and norms that there's a unilateralism like the US unilateralism up today versus collective action working together for a better world and that a lot of states put all the emphasis on their rights under international law but don't put any emphasis on their obligations and that's like Canada we contribute only 22 uh military personnel to UN peacekeeping right now when our our average um for the during the Cold War was 1,000 deployed and then there's a last principle of power versus uh principle that is that uh so many nations really spend their time uh thinking about power and the realpolitik and realism they don't think about principle or values or the international rules so they uh we have this huge challenge it's true that most nations abide by most laws most of the time but the outliers are so uh egregious and so obvious that it makes the news every day when these kind of violations of international law happen so these challenges that I was mentioning at the beginning they are global problems whether when one nation is attacked by another it's a problem for all of us because there it's like uh when one person is murdered uh it's a problem for all of us and we have to create the international mechanisms to deal with that just as we do at the national level we have police to investigate murders we need it the same thing to be done at the international level and all of these areas require strong international organizations so the mantra here is that global problems require global solutions and fortunately we have something to build on the UN has saved the world so many times uh from full-blown disasters and conflicts and uh otherwise we could very well have seen World War III but we have been able to keep this precious planet at least in some semblance of condition so most of us can live peacefully most of the time and that's us again on planet Earth as we try and make this a better place on which we can all inhabit in peace and uh under the rule of law thank you very much

well thank you Walter uh Dr Dorne that is a wonderful lecture that is uh very concise to think but also you covered a great deal of information and material and I would love to have a an actual live Q&A but we're at actually 27 minutes so we're a little over due to my enthusiasm for the points that you're making and I want to thank you I want to thank the people that are behind you Roméo Dallaire and I see you have a picture you have a drone and you have UN operations and we're in your actual office thank you so much for coming today and for talking to so many thousand hundreds of students including in future years I hope that you'll be uh I will show this again and again so thank you so much Walter uh Dr Dorne and uh good luck with everything that you're doing I'm going to stop the recording now if you don't mind

please thank you

# Transcript 6D

Okay, welcome to uh the 6D quiz and midterm exam information. I'm not using my face on the corner because there's always a lot of uh information that I want to include on each slide. This is my important advice about the quizzes and midterms. It's important to look on the calendar tab for the dates. If you're registered with accessible education, you will get an email confirmation that your extra time has been added. Each student has a certain amount of extra time. It's expressed as a ratio. You will get that email confirmation that you are um with accessible education in that group. If you don't get it and you are with accessible education, then you need to email us. But the chance of that is very low.

Where do you find out the quizzes and the exam times? Look on your calendar tool which is on your tab. You don't look in the course regulations. You don't look in the course rules, the course overview because the uh times can change unexpectedly. We can't predict when exam central will schedule or reschedule an exam. And it it has happened to me that uh OWL collapsed uh once and we had to reschedule the whole exam. Not my fault but OWL collapsed because too many students tried to get online across campus.

So the Senate Review Board SRBA which I served on for nine years or your academic counselor or the vice provost or dean reviews your appeal. That's why I don't put the dates inside the course regulations because then it's appealable. A course appeal is when you challenge a course regulation or decision. It's the regulations that are in those course regulations. I'll tell you right away, if you miss a quiz or exam, your counselor will fail your appeal because there's so many rules that they have everywhere. So, if you sleep in or you drive all night and you miss it, that's not grounds. You'll actually lose that that 40% exam or 10% um quiz which is over 5 days. Okay. So, course regulations required a structured appeal process and the university's academic calendar. The calendar by the university is subject to an appeal. But anyway, to make a long story short, things can change abruptly but not the course regulations. Those are set in stone.

Okay, surprise quiz. Uh we're going to just go through some questions here you haven't studied uh yet perhaps. And here's the question uh from the first uh uh sub-lesson 1a. And the answer here is which one of these questions is not useful to memorize which one? So you read it over um you eliminate the ones you read over the question. You eliminate the ones that are obviously not it. And you guess well it's E. Where were you born? Terrible question to ask anyone. Never, never, ever ask anyone where were you born. Not even a taxi driver. Never do that. It's really impolite and rude. Uh, so the right answer here is E. So the questions come at you. They're they're linear. You can't go back to question one. You have to keep going once you selected the answer. They're linear. So, you haven't taken the quiz.

Here's another one. I always put the lesson that it's from at the beginning. And I think most of the questions just make common sense. The answers are really obvious. Here's one. I mean, you've heard the lecture once. Uh, so you can kind of think about it. So, here, this is key. According to Professor Simpson because in your reality it might be a different answer but in the lecture according to my audio um what was what what is the recommended approach to making conversation? Uh so you read it over and you think about it and um you kind of try to remember what we were talking about so here I think that this is the right answer according to me according to that lecture obviously you might think it's more fun to talk about the Blue Jays, but the lecture said that it was to ask about their ideas.

Okay. If you have problems with a question, you are not allowed to take any screenshots during an exam or a quiz. That's a university policy that I'm required to continually repeat. So, if you send me a screenshot, that is actually something that could get you sent up to the dean's office because it's an academic offense. You took a screenshot during a test or a quiz. Uh what you need to do is write out the problematic question. Students have taken pictures of themselves writing out the problematic question basically. Um or or like take writing the problematic question out handwriting. So I can't read what their handwriting is um here. Why would they be doing that? Because they don't know what the answer is and they think I didn't lecture on it. Now, what I always do is the picture always relates to that lecture slide. I'm not unfair. I don't put unrelated pictures in that would confuse you. So, this picture is exactly from that lecture slide to twig your memory. And then here, what's the major event here? You can read it over. And sometimes there's two answers that seem to be fairly correct, but the lecture said it was B. COVID-19 pandemic.

Okay. So here um another question I'm just generating questions right now. So this is a question that I'm trying to work on. Um so you can see I'm adding nonsensical stuff although it might seem to make sense. Um, and then I'm you have to read my answers pretty carefully. But if you've listened to the lecture once, uh, and you've seen the PowerPoint, then you know that it's B. The correct answer is B.

Now, what you could do is just copy the whole question into chat into the free version, which I did to show you what's happening here. And chat is most of the time very, very correct. In fact, um it's amazing how correct that it is. But then sometimes it hallucinates because it wants to provide you always with a correct answer. So it will give an answer that it thinks is correct even though it's not. I'm I'm finding it interesting. Um so here we put in we into chat and chat says the correct answer is the correct answer. That's the free version.

Okay. So here I I've put the same question into Dr. Google using Ctrl+F. Now, it's hard to do that because I usually have pictures of the questions on the multiple choice. So, you're committing an academic offense. You're also having to retype the question uh because I've taken a picture of it. Not on all of them, but most of them that I think you might try to Ctrl+F on and that's an academic offense. So, here I I put it into Google and of course um Google gave me some different URLs. So, I I got distracted and I'm spending more than two minutes on this question trying to figure it out when I could have just read it, thought about it, and realized that it's B.

So, my warning once again is it is an academic scholastic offense and I insert images of the actual questions to prevent cheating. So, the question is photographed. If you attempt to use Google, you will be forced to retype the question manually. But I'm not really worried about Google at all. I'm worried about chat. And here what I want to mention to you is let's say you have not opened any of the lectures on Brightspace and then you use chat to answer all the questions and you're at home alone and nobody can see you. This someday we will figure out how to catch you and that will be considered an academic offense and you will someday be caught. It might it'll probably not be on my exam because it's too early in the life of ChatGPT but we have a committee and we're figuring out things and basically all I can tell you is you will be expelled from any university in Canada for cheating. If it's continual cheating the SRBA will expel you. And I've been on the SRBA and I've seen that happen. It's it's pretty upsetting. People end up having to leave Canada, their visa, one guy, remembered, had to go back to Saudi Arabia. His family lost all their money and he kept appealing trying to get us to change our minds. And no, he didn't. Anyway, do not risk your academic future.

Remember, I am not trying to trick you. My questions are not trying to trick you. Sometimes students will sit there and they'll go, "Oh, well, is she trying to trick me?" you know, maybe it's not that common sense answer and so on. No, just take your time. Read the question and answers a few times. Eliminate the answers that are obviously incorrect and choose the one that you think in your gut is the right answer.

Now, I want to warn you to protect your notes. If you use um uh Quizlet or you use a um uh notes that you put online, other students may find them to be outdated or incorrect because I update my lectures every every uh term. A lot of the old notes that I look at on Quizlet are amazingly outdated. You know, they might talk about NAFTA or something like that. Once I emailed a student because her notes were so poor and so hastily written that they were misleading students. They were getting lower marks. I was sure of it. So I emailed her and it turned out she was hiking in Nepal and she didn't realize that Quizlet had saved her notes because that's its default. Quizlet takes all the notes and default saves them. So she actually was so upset. I remember she hiked for three days back to a Wi-Fi place and then as soon as she'd removed her note, she emailed me from wherever it was in Nepal. So, do not risk your notes being used by others to cheat and take responsibility for what you share online. The ones that are selling the notes with the questions, I just laugh because there's there's literally 5,000 questions. So, how could you have gotten them? You don't have them.

The quickest way to study is to listen to the lecture one time and then review the slides one time. You don't have to listen to the lecture again, but you should listen to it once. Um now my issue is of course all now the new Brightspace you have to shorten all the lecture titles. I used to have in the question always have the lecture title but now they want only 50 characters which means I have to rewrite everything. I'm not sure I'm going to have time to do that to rewrite the whole thing. But anyway here's a sample question from 1B CA2135 on Canada's foreign policy liberal internationalism. I'm not obligated to put the whole lesson in. I can just put what the name was. What was the primary focus of Lester B. Pearson's Temple University [lecture]? Okay, so this is a bit of a harder challenging question. And so you just read all the answers and then I think on this point um I randomly pushes the the answers are the questions are linear but the answers are also randomized. They're randomized. So what was correct before was C but now what is correct is A. So that means that if someone's writing beside you they they'd say A is correct. Well you don't know what your A is different. Okay.

Now your friends will receive different questions different answers and the question pool is very large. So it is unlikely you will receive the same question twice. It's an academic offense to ask your friend to write the exam again because they got a high score and you didn't study. That's an academic offense and your friend will also be expelled if it is found out that you did that. So let's say your friend took the quiz three times and they took I mean they have literally at that point answered 120 questions. The pools are not large enough um for you not to encounter the or him or her whoever it is that you bribe to do that. Um so it is really a bad idea. Um, you should really try and take the quiz three times because it really helps you to figure out the questions and answers and it helps you to study. It really helps you. That's what it's meant to do. It's meant to help you.

Okay. PowerPoint slides are available including uh one set from the speaker Walter Dorne in lesson six. Let me mention that Brightspace can monitor whether students have opened windows and when. Uh WTS technicians and I can see if you've opened the course site and at what time and what date. Many students have not opened the course yet. Only a few are asking about course regulations like where is the quiz or the exam date in the course regulations. The um answer of course is in the course calendar and the chatbot also tells you uh the dates. Let me mention that I'm not going to be using that. I don't if there's an extra supplementary video I've done on my reasoning for that.

Following the call for the creation of UN peacekeeping force for Rwanda, no countries... So the answer would be zero. Um a lot of the questions uh are easily you can work your way through it if you listen to the lecture one time at high speed or if you've listened to it a couple of times. I think that it the exam is very easy. My best advice is to think it through. You do not need to study every word and concept that we explain. Relax and use your very powerful brain to figure out the right answers. Your best ally is your mind and not your notes. Don't use you're not allowed to use another screen. You're not allowed to go to another device like your phone to use Google or ChatGPT. Your best ally is your own very intelligent brain. So, good luck.

I've given you another example here to think it through. I I really think this is a very easy question. You do not need to study every word and concept that I explained to figure out that the right answer is C. Let me uh show that picture. That student would be committing a scholastic offense in my class. That's because they're consulting another screen and their notes. If you consult another screen during the midterm or the final exam, you have committed a scholastic offense and it will rest on your conscience.

Let me finally add that I have many uh supplementary lectures. I've recently added one on the UN uh one on Brightspace and its limitations uh the problems with how it's measuring. It does not accurately measure time spent on lectures or the use of library tools. I added one on how to travel the world with Dr. Bratt. In short, those supplementary lectures are there for your interest and your enrichment, but they are not on the enrichment, but they are not on the exam. I am not a medical professional. Uh there are also lectures on how to overcome anxiety, fear, how to overcome fear of public speaking, perfectionism, but these are suggestions only and are not examinable.

Finally, um try to quell your brain's anxiety by putting anxiety into a relaxing chair based on the movie. Put a list on your fridge or in your pocket of your favorite activities and call this your extreme self-care list. Every day do at least one thing on your list uh in order to deal with the inevitable anxiety um that that is experienced by everyone. Thank you for listening.
