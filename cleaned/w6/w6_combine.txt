Here's the cleaned-up transcript:

**Lecture on the Emergence of Global Governance**

Welcome to the lesson on the emergence of global governance. As you can tell, we're going to be going through a lot of information in preparation for a very special guest, Dr. Walter Dorne.

In my last lecture, I suggested that Canada should place armed troops along the longest undefended border in the world, and that would arguably slash a psychological wound between Canada and the United States. I also suggested a made-in-Canada peacekeeping operation.

If we think back to the emergence of COVID, it shut the Canada-US border down completely. But it was the speed with which leaders of historically friendly countries agreed to go their separate ways that left indelible scars.

President Trump's threats to annex Canada as the 51st US state and to impose 25% trade tariffs are undermining the trust between Canadians and Americans, and leading many Canadians — and even Americans — to buy Canadian. We're hearing that many Canadian goods, including Arva Mills in London, Ontario, are being inundated with requests. What will happen next?

Under the pressure of a tiny virus, our paths diverged and our common US border widened. But the announcements by President Trump since the inauguration on January 20th, 2025 are creating more division rather than unity. As our economies become more strained and our healthcare systems are tested on both sides, the world cannot help but bear witness to growing divisions.

There is fear about President Trump's suggestion to move 2.1 million Palestinians out of their ancestral grounds in the Gaza Strip to ready it for a US takeover — what could amount to an ethnic cleansing. Despite centuries of living in Palestine, the threat is there.

So this lecture discusses global governance and the United Nations in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now American threats to take over Canada, Greenland, the Panama Canal, and the Gaza Strip, as well as the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," which is already being reflected in American maps. This lecture also takes place in the context of deportations.

**COVID-19: Deaths and Public Opinion**

According to Worldometer — a URL provided in the extra notes — more than 1 million people, exactly 1,090,082, in the United States succumbed to COVID as of October 2022. Canada lost 45,689 people, a much smaller number and a smaller rate of 843 people per million. Canada's health system and its rigorous standards — closing borders, cities, and institutions like this university — meant a significantly lower death rate.

Public opinion in the United States was marked by negative ratings of presidents and deep political divisions, with few having confidence in either President Trump or his successor President Biden during the pandemic. Curiously, Prime Minister Trudeau's popularity increased dramatically during the pandemic, with almost two-thirds of Canadians approving of his handling of the virus. That's quite a switch from now, when he has recently resigned after nine years as prime minister and will not be running again.

Looking back, his liberal internationalism and evidence-based feminist approach was marked by cooperation and level-headed thinking. That feminist approach is still being followed at Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa. However, Trudeau resigned under a cloud, partly seen as anti-feminist following the abrupt and surprising resignation of his Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Freeland ran for the Liberal leadership against Mark Carney — former Bank of Canada Governor — and others including Karina Gould. Freeland lost, and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who had been widely expected to become Prime Minister, lost the election including his own seat, leading to Carney's minority government.

**Canada-US Relations and Global Governance**

Canada-US relations are being judged in the court of both domestic and international public opinion. People are watching how both countries handle COVID's aftermath, tariffs, and the new administration's rapid-fire announcements.

During his first term in February 2021, Donald Trump proposed slashing 21% of foreign aid. Now in 2025, he has cut all of it and is attempting to fire all USAID federal employees — though a judge has temporarily blocked that. In contrast, Canada very quietly announced $159.5 million in humanitarian aid to a range of organizations including the Red Cross, UNICEF, and Gavi, the vaccine alliance. The question is: will Canada step up and spend even more on humanitarian aid?

During the pandemic, President Trump withheld more than $400 million from the World Health Organization, claiming it had a Chinese bias. Now he is trying to withdraw the United States from the WHO entirely. Canada, by contrast, paid its dues and voluntarily increased its contribution by millions. We certainly cannot make up for the US cuts, but it is instructive to contrast the two different approaches to global governance and international institutions.

During the pandemic, Trump also threatened to ban the export of personal protective equipment — gloves, masks, and so on — including to neighboring Canada. We forget how many threats there were back then.

I want to draw your attention to Karina Gould. At the time, as Minister of International Development, she stepped up greatly to help convene the international Group of Friends on Food and Nutrition Security. I remember thinking at the time: who is this very young Member of Parliament confronting all of this and standing up in the House of Commons saying we're going to spend more to alleviate a hunger pandemic?

She was a Liberal leadership hopeful — just 37 years old, the youngest candidate in the race. She wanted to cut the federal sales tax and lower the GST by 4%. She was ultimately unable to raise the funds needed to mount a full leadership campaign, and Freeland lost to Mark Carney.

The province of Ontario also held an early election, re-electing Doug Ford with a majority government. These municipal, federal, and provincial elections are a good opportunity for students to observe and invigilate elections — experience that could prepare you to help monitor foreign elections, perhaps for the United Nations.

Perhaps most indicative of America's growing isolationism and Canada's increasing solidarity with the community of nations was a proposal at the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire — asking all nations to stop armed conflict while humanity faced the common threat of COVID-19. It was an international call for common sense, and the United States was the lone voice of opposition, vetoing the ceasefire proposal.

COVID remains a global threat. The most recent revelation, tweeted by Elon Musk — so reliability is uncertain — was that the United States was intentionally funding research at the Wuhan lab in China. This is confusing on its face: why would the US fund research at a Chinese lab that could be used against the US? It may simply be confusion, because the CIA announced just days ago that the Wuhan lab leak theory is now considered the most likely source of COVID. The CIA is reporting it was likely not a natural virus from an animal black market, but a virus that escaped from a Chinese military lab due to poor laboratory protocol. When I circulated this information to the international Pugwash movement, someone wrote to me that it was racist to say so — but why would identifying a lab leak be racist? The fact of the matter is that neither China, the United States, nor Russia follow proper protocol, and it is sadly inevitable that viruses will continue to escape and spread around the world.

**The Path Forward: Global Governance and the SDGs**

What is our path forward toward health, well-being, and a more virus-free world? It is linked to many other global challenges: poverty, food insecurity, human insecurity, and climate change. None of these problems can be tackled alone — no country, no person can solve them. We need a united path forward.

This has been eloquently laid out by the UN in what's called Agenda 2030, more commonly referred to as the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. I'm wearing my SDG brooch today — you can buy scarves, pins, and all sorts of items symbolizing your commitment to the SDGs. There are 17 goals in total.

These are visionary goals. They are not going to be fully achieved by 2030, or in our lifetimes, or even our grandchildren's lifetimes. But they are a vision of how we can live together peacefully as humankind on planet Earth. People often say, "Well, if they're not going to happen, why bother?" — but they are a vision to work toward. You'll see many UN delegates wearing the SDG colors, and when you do, you know you share those goals.

The goals include clean water for the world — there is currently no clean water at all in the Gaza Strip — no poverty, decent work, economic growth, climate action, preserving the world's oceans, and what I'm focusing on today: strong institutions, global governance, and the emergence of international institutions.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has appealed for accelerated change in this decade of action toward 2030. It is a common path forward that desperately needs world leaders whose vocabulary champions words like "together" and "solidarity," rather than words of division. Canada officially champions the SDGs, and this university is ranked at the top in Canada — and I believe in the world — for commitment to the SDGs. Our president has been among the most vocal advocates. That's why you see the posters everywhere, and we should be very proud of that.

The SDGs have become a working language and mantra of the Canadian federal government. Until you go to the United Nations or to Ottawa, you don't realize how deeply embedded the SDGs are in how people think and work.

**Closing Remarks**

To close, a digital movement map of Canadian organizations identifies almost 12,000 civil society groups working on the SDGs — 12,000 different organizations across Canada working toward a resilient, common future. That is an astounding number of people volunteering toward this vision.

I do have a supplementary lecture on voluntary organizations if you'd like to explore that further. I highly suggest volunteering — even just for a week during your February break. Volunteer for free, show your commitment to their cause and their shared tasks, and they may well find the money to hire you for a summer position or something longer term. Work toward what you're passionate about, and I'm certain you will build a truly meaningful career.

Thank you for listening.
# Lesson 6B: Welcome to Global Governance

Today, nowhere is leadership needed more than at the United Nations — not just at the UN General Assembly, which is a talk shop for resolutions as we learned last week, but rather at the UN Security Council, pictured here. That's where global security concerns are hotly debated.

## Trump's Gaza Proposal and International Law

A Gaza takeover would violate international law according to experts — not just according to me.

President Trump has declared that the United States should take over the Gaza Strip, permanently transfer its entire 2.1 million population to Egypt and Jordan (the neighboring countries), and redevelop it into what he calls the "Riviera of the Middle East." "Riviera" refers to a kind of resort along a river, with hotels presumably.

That proposal, which Trump unveiled during a press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — often called "Bibi," his nickname, the longest-serving Prime Minister of Israel, pictured here — would unquestionably be a severe violation of international law. It looks like they agreed that Bibi was not taken by surprise, because Israeli soldiers are already being ordered to clear the land and forcibly push people out, though we're not entirely sure yet.

Forcible deportation — when you forcibly deport rather than attract people through voluntary immigration — or the forced transfer of a civilian population is a violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime, and it is a crime against humanity.

The international prohibition against forced deportations of civilians has been part of the law of war since the Lieber Code, a set of rules on the conduct of hostilities first promulgated by Union forces during the U.S. Civil War. The image here shows diplomats signing the Geneva Conventions after World War II and the Nuremberg trials. These norms have been in place since World War II — and arguably before that.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists forcible population transfers as both a war crime and a crime against humanity. If the displacement is focused, as it is here, on a particular group based on their ethnic, religious, or national identity, then it also constitutes persecution — an additional crime.

Palestine is an observer to the UN General Assembly and is an actual state party to the International Criminal Court, so that court has jurisdiction over crimes committed within Gaza, even if committed by citizens of the United States, which is not a member of the court. The ICC is an organ of the United Nations situated in The Hague, Europe.

When Trump was asked how much of Gaza's population he wanted to move, he said, "All of them," adding, "I would think they would be thrilled." When pressed by a journalist on whether he would force them to go even if they did not want to, Trump said, "I don't think they're going to tell me no."

I'm sure most of you saw that press conference. I know a lot of my students have written to me — including students from two or three years ago — and I want to mention: you can still email me after you graduate. I'm always happy to hear from you.

Professor Simpson reminds all of you that this forcible deportation would be a straightforward war crime. To advocate this scale of coercion and forced removal would make this a crime against humanity.

---

## The United Nations and Palestinian Statehood

The United Nations recognized Palestine as a permanent Observer State — not a full recognized state party — and 146 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine as a state, though the United States does not.

The prohibition on one state annexing all or part of another state's territory is one of the most foundational principles of the post-Westphalian era. It is a principle not just of international law, but one the entire world recognized when Russia invaded Ukraine — that annexation could not be abided.

States — and you can quote me — cannot conquer someone else's territory. If a state violates that rule, as in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the response must be widespread condemnation. Aggression, which the ICC defines as a state using force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, is also a crime. So I am talking about crimes here.

President Trump continues to seem unconcerned with how his proposal might be viewed by the global institutions that underpin the international legal system.

## Trump's Actions Toward International Institutions

We will be speaking this week with a famous peacekeeper, Dr. Walter Dorn, on international institutions, and I'm sure he'll have a lot to say about President Trump's lack of concern for U.S. participation in those institutions.

We're seeing a flurry of announcements from President Trump. On February 5th, 2025, he signed an executive order calling for a general review of U.S. funding and involvement in the United Nations, raising serious questions about the United States' commitment to that global institution. The newly inaugurated President has also already withdrawn the United States from the UN Human Rights Council. Trump is casually making policy proposals that propose to violate the absolute bedrock principles of international law.

We talked before about Russia in the Security Council, and we will be talking more about Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Ukraine as well — but let's move on.

---

## Will the UN Security Council Take Action?

Will the UN Security Council take action? We know that leaders like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — pictured here, look how young he is — have condemned Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide. He has already come out very strongly and said that the possible U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip is intolerable.

In 2020, Canada competed with Norway and Ireland for an elected seat on the rotating UN Security Council. Norway and Ireland are both generous donors when it comes to international aid — they easily beat out Canada despite last-minute lobbying by the Canadian delegation.

I've shown you the picture of the UN Security Council chamber, which is located in the United States. We're going to see what happens. Could the United Nations even move? Could it move to Canada? That would be interesting.

## Canada's International Development Record

The former Liberal Prime Minister Lester Pearson originally set the agreed-upon standard of 0.7% of gross national product to be spent on development aid — a bar that nations were supposed to aspire to. He was one of what are called the "three wise men." When he proposed this back in the 1970s, only the Scandinavian countries, including Norway and Denmark, have actually reached and exceeded it. Ireland is far ahead of Canada.

President Trump has cut all U.S. aid, and that affects hundreds of aid organizations around the world right now. Millions of people who rely on U.S. aid to survive are being prevented from obtaining it. I've juxtaposed here two images: President Trump looking triumphant, and Lester B. Pearson — called by the international community one of the wise men — looking quite sad.

## Canada's Feminist Foreign Policy and the Security Council Bid

Canada's so-called feminist, intersectionalist international approach — though duly lauded — has not translated into meaningful development contributions. Our measure of international development has been lagging for decades. It is approximately 0.28% of gross national income. Even when Karina Gould was Minister of International Development, she was not able to bring it higher than that. That is really low.

Canadians share a global identity marked by international cooperation, multilateralism, and a commitment to global citizenship — and you are in my class here learning about Canada abroad. I also teach Global Diplomacy and a class called Global Violence.

Now, in those classes I did not cover this, but I want to spend a moment on the official secret vote among UN ambassadors that took place in June 2020. I happened to be in New York City at the time. Canada lost terribly. The UN General Assembly countries simply did not vote for Canada. The Canadians thought they were going to win — I was talking to them and they were saying, "Oh yeah, we're going to get in there." No way.

The media tended to contrast Canada's values with the current American leadership back then, and there was a notable divergence — which may become even more notable now.

In 2020, it proved not to be Canada's time. Even with feminist international leadership and a caring international reputation, we were not able to sit across the table from the United States, China, and Russia — the P5 powers — and speak up strongly for a better world that is surely listening now.

Will Canada serve on the UN Security Council soon? I do not think so, because recent contributions to peacekeeping are so low. Dr. Walter Dorn will surely address those low contributions, as he has been one of the foremost critics of Canada's peacekeeping record.

Prime Minister Trudeau, pictured in the House of Commons on June 18th, 2020, said the Liberal government knew Canada was behind its competitors when it announced its intention to run for a seat, but hoped it could make up the difference during the campaign. This sounds like the same refrain all the time. I was there during their $50 million campaign — I didn't take any money, but I was there for different reasons — and it was clear: Canada was too late. Our peacekeeping reputation was seen as poor by many countries in the UN General Assembly. Dr. Dorn will speak to that, I'm sure.

## Guest Speaker: Dr. Walter Dorn

Pictured here is Dr. Walter Dorn — what I call a "media person" who regularly appears on CTV, CBC, and CBC Radio. He is a professor at the Royal Military College and the Canadian Forces College, an officer professional program. He has spoken to Canadians from hotspots like Nepal, East Timor, and various African countries that he has visited. He'll be speaking with us shortly.

My final slide shows him, I believe, on CBC discussing the first anniversary of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Dr. Dorn and I are often in the media together or separately, and we refer each other frequently.

I'm very happy he agreed to join us, even though he is extremely busy. His only stipulation is that he definitely wants students to be present. That will be challenging — my Zoom has a capacity limit, and I also cannot assign participation marks, since some of you are in China, Nepal, or in nursing with all-day practicums.

What I can offer is this: if you do come and ask a question, I will make careful note of it. If I ever end up writing a reference letter for you, that would be something I would love to mention — because asking a question of a guest speaker is genuinely difficult, and I am very aware of that.

I will be hosting him as soon as I can pin him down, and I look forward to your reaction. Thanks for listening.

Hello everyone. I am very delighted to introduce to you Dr. Walter Dorne, who is a wonderful professor at the Canadian Forces College and at the Royal Military College. As I mentioned in my lecture, he has appeared very often on CTV and CBC. You may have seen him or heard him on CBC Radio. He is a noted, world-renowned peacekeeper, and he has a PhD from the University of Toronto in chemistry. He also knows a lot about chemical weapons and peacekeeping training. I am delighted that he has come to speak to us about the evolution of international institutions. Thank you, Walter, for coming.

Erica, thank you so much. I really appreciate being with you and with your students. I am delighted to work with you over the years, and now to present and share. I am going to speak about the evolution of international organization, because in our current day we see that international organizations are under siege. You have US president Donald Trump who has withdrawn from the World Health Organization just after a major pandemic struck the Earth. You also have withdrawing from major UN institutions, like the institution that helps gazin at a time of their desperate need. We have all kinds of challenges even to international law, including trade law, like the threat of trade tariffs, which can be challenged in the World Trade Organization. The United States is not even abiding by the World Trade Organization rulings.

So we have to look at how we got to this place where we are now, and realize that this is actually behavior that was typical of 100 to 200 years ago. This is normal behavior of humanity. Then we say, well, how did we create all these institutions that we take for granted? I am going to do a quick historical overview to show the evolution of international organization.

Wow, that is great.

I will do so very much in the Simpson fashion, with lots of slides, lots of eye candy to share, so you can get the visual dimension to go along with the content.

Thank you, Walter.

You are very welcome. This is our planet, Planet Earth. This particular image is called Blue Marble. We are floating in outer space, and we seem to be a pretty amazing planet if you look at it from outer space. All the astronauts seem to come back with a different realization of our common humanity, having seen the world as a whole and from outer space. We realize that it is actually a beautiful planet with a very thin atmosphere that is very vulnerable. It is only 1% of the diameter of the Earth. It is a very vulnerable atmosphere, but we rely on it for our very existence.

If you look more carefully, you see there are so many global challenges. We have aggression and conflict, weapons of mass destruction and mass murder. We have diseases and climate, huge climate changes, climate change problems, crime and terrorism, human trafficking, cyber threats, and so much more. This peaceful planet is actually filled with problems. You might ask yourself: How do the inhabitants of this planet deal with these problems? What is the best that they are doing to deal with these things?

To see that, you have to look at how international organization has evolved. I will start off with the first cataclysmic world war, World War I. There was a clash of empires, where countries felt that they could rule other areas of the Earth and their colonies. They were challenging each other, fighting over colonies, and they came to a major catastrophic war. Some 15 million were killed in that war. Afterwards there was an idea that maybe we can do things better. We do not have to have the right of conquest, and we cannot have governance without the consent of the governed.

This was the origin of international organization for peace. It came in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and it came out of Woodrow Wilson, the US president, who at the time thought the Europeans really have to do things differently if they are going to survive, and if the world is going to survive. He came up with 14 points, the last of which was to create what he called a general association of nations that must be formed under specific covenants, with the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.

You see the notion there that others should have political independence and territorial integrity, that you cannot just go and acquire another territory because you want to, like Russia is doing now over Ukraine. It is a blatant violation of international law as it has been developed. This principle is fairly new. It is 100 plus a few years old, and we really have to fight for it.

In the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, Woodrow Wilson wanted to create this international organization, but the British prime minister Lloyd George wanted to maintain the British Empire. The French premier George Closo wanted to have a UN, sorry, a League of Nations force that would be able to beat Germany if Germany attacked again. Wilson wanted a system based not on selfish national interest but on the broad international interest, based on international ideals. We see this debate between narrow-minded nationalism and broad-minded internationalism again and again in human history, and it is facing us once again now. Of course, we have a bigger, better foundation on which to build.

In the great debate of 1919, Woodrow Wilson thought there had to be not a balance of power but one single overwhelming powerful group of nations who shall be the trustee of the peace of the world. Nations have to come together in collective security, not just collective defense against an enemy, but collective security against anyone who would violate international law.

Henry C. Lodge Jr., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, thought we should keep the United States out of the League. He wanted America to be much more choosy about when it intervened, and not based on international law. The United States did stay out of the League of Nations for the 15 years that the League existed. Of course, World War II came, and the United States was shaken out of a stupor by the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. It joined the nations to fight against Germany and Japan, and then realized we have to do something better than what we did after the First World War. We have got to create a stronger League of Nations, which they called the United Nations.

The properties and principles of the League became incorporated into a better and stronger United Nations, and the headquarters moved from Geneva to New York. The UN managed to do something the League never did. It achieved universality. The 193 members of the UN represent pretty much all the people of the globe. There are hardly any more new nations to join after South Sudan joined in 2011, and then Montenegro before that, and Timor-Leste in 2002. This is a real achievement of bringing human beings together from all around the planet.

What do they get together for? To maintain international peace and security, to have equal rights and self-determination of peoples, to solve international problems, and to harmonize the actions of nations. It is all according to the UN Charter, which also says there is a sovereign equality of all its members. Under the law in Canada, one person does not have more legal rights than another. They have equality under the law. The UN Charter also asks in Article 2, paragraph 4, that states refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the political independence or territorial integrity. That again comes right out of Woodrow Wilson’s 14th point. They also agreed, all those 193 nations agreed, to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.

The UN Charter also provides for peaceful settlement of disputes, for negotiation, inquiry, mediation, and referral to courts. It also has an enforcement provision in Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, where nations and the UN can apply sanctions and actually use military force to back international law. But it has a big caveat saying that nations have an inherent right of self-defense when they are under attack, not if they are thinking an attack will come, but if an armed attack occurs, until the Security Council has taken action. There are other chapters for regional organizations and for social and economic progress, because nations realized that part of the problem of the rise of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan was social and economic conditions after World War I. They realized we had to create an international organization that also dealt with that.

The UN has a General Assembly, a Security Council, an Economic and Social Council, a Trusteeship Council which does not exist anymore, and an International Court of Justice, as well as a Secretariat headed by a UN Secretary-General. A lot of the action, the headquarters is in New York, and the Secretariat is this tall glass building on 1 Avenue. The Secretary-General has his office on the 38th floor. The Security Council meeting is by the East River down on, in this picture here. The Economic and Social Council is on the other side, and the General Assembly is that big building with the dome top that you see there.

The General Assembly has all members, all 193. Each has five representatives, and one country has one vote. You need a two-thirds majority to get a substantive decision, and a simple majority, that is half the votes, in order to get a procedural motion passed, a resolution. They meet in September. Usually the heads of state come for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly. They also have special sessions.

The Security Council: In 1945, the member states who were negotiating in San Francisco, who wanted to join and become part of this organization, agreed very reluctantly that some nations, in fact the most powerful nations at the time, would have a seat on the Security Council. That has been pretty much frozen in time, except for a switch from Kuomintang China to the People’s Republic of China. It is really a reflection of the world order of 1945. Unfortunately they did not create a mechanism by which new states can automatically be part of the Security Council if they rise in power, or other mechanisms for creating Security Council permanent members that are more fair. There are 10 permanent members now, and they come from different regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Latin America. But there are lots of problems. There is lots of politics being played in the Security Council, and Russia has vetoed so many resolutions dealing with Ukraine.

I myself managed to get a little seat for at least a few seconds at the UN Security Council. I took that picture in the year that Canada was trying to get a seat on the Security Council. Unfortunately they did not, but I did.

Joking aside, here is the Economic and Social Council, which Canada does chair now. Bob Rae, our ambassador in the UN, is the chair of the ECOSOC, and it also oversees the specialized agencies and the NGOs now. You may try and guess these. I do not have much time to allow you time to think about what they are, but the first is the International Civil Aviation Organization based in Montreal. Second one is International Labor Organization. Third is International Maritime Organization. You can look at the others and see if any of them you can guess, maybe the UNICEF one, number six, you can guess.

So here they are: the International Telecommunication Union on the second level, UNESCO, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNICEF, Children’s organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, and World Meteorological Organization, all important in their own areas for dealing with global problems which require global solutions.

More broadly, we have an organization to deal with atomic energy, human rights, refugees, and really importantly now, the World Trade Organization. So if nations are unfairly imposing tariffs, then the World Trade Organization has mechanisms to be able to do hearings on them, and if nations really abide by the WTO, we would be able to solve them.

The UN has agencies, funds, and programs as well. NGOs have expanded very much at the UN. I was just applying for an annual pass today for an NGO representing at the UN, that is the Canadian Pugwash group. There is also the judicial branch, which is the International Court of Justice based in The Hague. The Trusteeship Council no longer has a purpose because all of those territories have gained independence. The UN Secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General, with a Department of Peace Operations that has some 60,000 uniform personnel in different hotspots in the world.

The Secretaries-General have been from different parts of the world. If you look at the list at the top, it is Trig Lee, then comes Sweden, Trig Lee from Norway, then D. Harold from Sweden, Uon from Burma, Kurt Voltime from Austria, AIA Pqu from Peru, Budris Budris Gali from Egypt, Ganan from Ghana, Bony Moon from South Korea, and Antonio Gues from Portugal.

Now, what has the organization achieved? I talk about these long perspective, centuries achievements. The UN has been around for over 75 years. What can you say it has achieved? Number one: decolonization. If you look at when the UN was created, there were so many nations that were colonies, and that decolonization process really sped up in the 1960s. Here you can see the different years when the different nations got their independence.

We also had the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is used in many national constitutions, including our own, and it is something that is very widely accepted all around the world through specific covenants that come out of the UDHR, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

We also have the development of international law dealing with the sea through the UN Convention Law of the Sea, Outer Space Treaty, a whole bunch of disarm treaties that are very important, and we have international criminal law, which just started to evolve after the Nuremberg trials in 1945-46. There was a long pause where we did not have an International Criminal Court until quite recently, created in 2002. We have an international prosecutor who has actually now indicted the president of Russia and the prime minister of Israel. It is a very bold move to challenge power.

There are times when the Security Council played a major role, like the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, where the Ambassador Adelay Stevenson would challenge the Russians, and he actually showed pictures of missiles in order to prove to the world that Russia was clandestinely putting missiles into Cuba.

Lots of progress on peacemaking and peacekeeping. Peacekeeping: the first peacekeeping force was created at the initiative of Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State at the time, in 1956 to solve the Suez Crisis. He managed to convince D. Harold that this was a good idea, and then many more peacekeeping missions were created all around the world to deal with hotspots and to help resolve them. That is a way that international presence can be felt on the ground, to have the eyes and ears of the UN there.

Of course there have been difficult situations like Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and General Delaire has described in great detail in his book, Shake Hands with the Devil, how he was facing those who were committing the genocide and killing some 800,000 people. But with just 300 peacekeepers, Delaire was able to save 20,000 to 30,000 lives because they were showing a presence, and the general CS did not want to do their slaughter in front of the UN. There was still an example, even though Rwanda is overall a failure of the international community, the UN was able to do amazing things with a very small force there.

We have the Bosnia situation, and my friend Patrick Reckner was actually chained to an antenna as a human shield against NATO bombing, but subsequently released, and now Bosnia is at peace after several peace operations. I remember when that happened to Patrick, because it was terrible for him.

How long was he chained to that pole?

Well, a few weeks. Well, a few weeks, he was, or days, I cannot remember, but it was terrible for him. Also I just want to emphasize: How many troops did General Romeo Delaire ask for? Only 500 troops, and he got zero. But you were saying that he used 300 to prevent some of the genocide. Originally the UNAMIR force was 5,000. They never quite got it to their authorized strength. Then the Secretary-General sent to the Security Council three options: to reduce the force down to 300, or to increase it to 20,000, or to keep it as is. He said the current, as is, is not working. So the Security Council authorized the strength to go down to just 300, or 250 I think it was. General Delaire, with almost 300 troops, managed to save all those lives.

This is an example, students, of how important it is to remember these numbers, to know the facts. You can see that Dr. Doran has an incredible memory for facts, and even there, recalling what happened in the past, he can remember all this, and that is important. That is why I will quiz you on a lot of these dates, a lot of these times, and also a lot of the pictures, and keep that in mind for the multiple choice. I am looking at it now and thinking, well, what can I do for multiple choice, remembering that the students can remember pretty well everything that you say, Walter. So keep going. This is an excellent lecture. I really, really appreciate it.

Sure. We can make the PowerPoint available so anyone can look at it afterwards.

Oh, okay. That would be great.

This is a plaque at my college, the Canadian Forces College here in Toronto, which shows the names of those who died. It was the graduating class of 99 who gave this to the college, and it is those who served in peacekeeping operations and died in that cause.

We have an expansion of peacekeeping. Originally they were doing just military observers. Then they did buffer zones and armed interposed forces, and then multi-dimensional, where they are doing so many activities, including police monitoring and bringing police into the missions. They did economic and social reconstruction and judicial work. Just a tremendous amount of expansion of peacekeeping tasks.

Here is a graph since 1991 of the number of uniform peacekeepers, that is military and police, deployed to the field. In the Cold War it was typically around 10,000. Then it went to 80,000. Then in the new century it really expanded to get to 108,000. Now, since Trump was elected the first time, it started to go down. You see it is down now to around, well, 60 or 70,000 uniform personnel.

The UN has used enforcement sanctions many times. During the Cold War, only twice, in Rhodesia and South Africa, but afterwards many times. They used military enforcement action. For the first time an international organization used force in Korea in 1950 to repel aggression. Big step forward for humanity.

Now, I have to also, there you have Afghanistan 1999 till now. See, 1999 Afghanistan for sanctions present, those are the sanctions?

Yeah.

Okay. Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

Going on to other areas of progress, there is a huge achievement of humanity bringing hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Even though humanity has grown from six billion at the turn of this millennium to currently eight billion, there are actually fewer people who are desperately poor. That is really a testament to the effectiveness of our global AIDS strategies, and it is very unfortunate that President Trump has cut off the funding and is firing the employees of the largest aid organization in the world, the USAID, which is Agency for International Development.

Also, eradication. We actually took a disease and took it off of the Earth, so that it could no longer bother humanity again. We would like to do this with other things like polio, but there are still difficulties completely eradicating that.

Going to a conclusion, we have huge humanitarian challenges in different parts of the world today. There is a huge need for international organization to get involved, for peacekeeping forces, and for humanitarian law, IHL, international humanitarian law, to apply to these areas, so we can get proper conduct of military and non-military forces.

But in the UN, we see that it is not able to act as a world government. There are still these competing tendencies between sovereignty and the international rules and norms. There is unilateralism, like the US unilateralism today, versus collective action, working together for a better world. A lot of states put all the emphasis on their rights under international law, but do not put any emphasis on their obligations. That is like Canada. We contribute only 22 military personnel to UN peacekeeping right now, when our average during the Cold War was 10,000 deployed.

Then there is a last principle: power versus principle. So many nations really spend their time thinking about power, realpolitik and realism. They do not think about principle or values or the international rules. We have this huge challenge. It is true that most nations abide by most laws most of the time, but the outliers are so egregious and so obvious that it makes the news every day when these kinds of violations of international law happen.

These challenges that I mentioned at the beginning are global problems. When one nation is attacked by another, it is a problem for all of us, because it is like when one person is murdered, it is a problem for all of us. We have to create international mechanisms to deal with that, just as we do at the national level. We have police to investigate murders. We need the same thing to be done at the international level. All of these areas require strong international organizations.

So the mantra here is that global problems require global solutions. Fortunately we have something to build on. The UN has saved the world so many times from full-blown disasters and conflicts. Otherwise we could very well have seen World War III. But we have been able to keep this precious planet at least in some semblance of condition so most of us can live peacefully most of the time. That is us again on Planet Earth, as we try and make this a better place on which we can all inhabit in peace and under the rule of law. Thank you very much.

Well thank you Walter, Dr. Dorne. That is a wonderful lecture. That is very concise, I think, but also you covered a great deal of information and material. I would love to have an actual live Q&A, but we are at actually 27 minutes, so we are a little over due to my enthusiasm for the points that you are making. I want to thank you. I want to thank the people that are behind you. Romeo Delaire, and I see you have a picture, you have a drone, and you have UN operations, and we are in your actual office. Thank you so much for coming today, and for talking to so many thousand, hundreds of students, including in future years. I hope that I will show this again and again. Thank you so much, Walter, Dr. Dorne, and good luck with everything that you are doing. I am going to stop the recording now, if you do not mind.

Please. Thank you.

Okay, welcome to the 6D quiz and midterm exam information.

I’m not using my face on the corner because there’s always a lot of information that I want to include on each slide.

This is my important advice about the quizzes and midterms. It’s important to look on the calendar tab for the dates.

If you’re registered with Accessible Education, you will get an email confirmation that your extra time has been added. Each student has a certain amount of extra time. It’s expressed as a ratio. You will get that email confirmation that you are with Accessible Education in that group. If you don’t get it and you are with Accessible Education, then you need to email us. But the chance of that is very low.

Where do you find out the quizzes and the exam times? Look on your calendar tool, which is on your tab. You don’t look in the course regulations. You don’t look in the course rules, the course overview, because the times can change unexpectedly.

We can’t predict when Exam Central will schedule or reschedule an exam. And it has happened to me that OWL collapsed once and we had to reschedule the whole exam. Not my fault, but OWL collapsed because too many students tried to get online across campus.

So the Senate Review Board, SRBA, which I served on for nine years, or your academic counselor, or the Vice-Provost, or Dean reviews your appeal. That’s why I don’t put the dates inside the course regulations, because then it’s appealable. A course appeal is when you challenge a course regulation or decision. It’s the regulations that are in those course regulations.

I’ll tell you right away, if you miss a quiz or exam, your counselor will not fail your appeal because there’s so many rules that they have everywhere. So, if you sleep in or you drive all night and you miss it, that’s not grounds. You’ll actually lose that 40% exam or 10% quiz, which is over five days.

Okay. So, course regulations require a structured appeal process and the university’s academic calendar. The calendar by the university is subject to an appeal. But anyway, to make a long story short, things can change abruptly, but not the course regulations. Those are set in stone.

Okay, surprise quiz. We’re going to just go through some questions here you haven’t studied yet, perhaps. And here’s the question from the first sub-lesson, 1A. And the answer here is: which one of these questions is not useful to memorize? Which one? So you read it over, you eliminate the ones, you read over the question, you eliminate the ones that are obviously not it, and you guess, well, it’s E: “Where were you born?”

Terrible question to ask anyone. Never, never, ever ask anyone, “Where were you born?” Not even a taxi driver. Never do that. It’s really impolite and rude. So the right answer here is E.

So the questions come at you. They’re linear. You can’t go back to question one. You have to keep going once you’ve selected the answer. They’re linear.

So, you haven’t taken the quiz. Here’s another one. I always put the lesson that it’s from at the beginning. And I think most of the questions just make common sense. The answers are really obvious. Here’s one. I mean, you’ve heard the lecture once, so you can kind of think about it.

So here, this is key: “according to Professor Simpson,” because in your reality it might be a different answer, but in the lecture, according to my audio, what is the recommended approach to making conversation? So you read it over and you think about it, and you kind of try to remember what we were talking about. So here, I think that this is the right answer according to me, according to that lecture. Obviously, you might think it’s more fun to talk about the Blue Jays, but the lecture said that it was to ask about their ideas.

Okay. If you have problems with a question, you are not allowed to take any screenshots during an exam or a quiz. That’s a university policy that I’m required to continually repeat. So, if you send me a screenshot, that is actually something that could get you sent up to the Dean’s office because it’s an academic offense. You took a screenshot during a test or a quiz.

What you need to do is write out the problematic question. Students have taken pictures of themselves writing out the problematic question, basically, or like writing the problematic question out by hand. So I can’t read what their handwriting is here. Why would they be doing that? Because they don’t know what the answer is and they think I didn’t lecture on it.

Now, what I always do is the picture always relates to that lecture slide. I’m not unfair. I don’t put unrelated pictures in that would confuse you. So, this picture is exactly from that lecture slide to twig your memory. And then here, what’s the major event here? You can read it over. And sometimes there’s two answers that seem to be fairly correct, but the lecture said it was B: COVID-19 pandemic.

Okay. So here, another question. I’m just generating questions right now. So this is a question that I’m trying to work on. So you can see I’m adding nonsensical stuff, although it might seem to make sense. And then you have to read my answers pretty carefully. But if you’ve listened to the lecture once, and you’ve seen the PowerPoint, then you know that it’s B. The correct answer is B.

Now, what you could do is just copy the whole question into chat, into the free version, which I did to show you what’s happening here. And chat is most of the time very, very correct. In fact, it’s amazing how correct that it is. But then sometimes it hallucinates because it wants to provide you always with a correct answer. So it will give an answer that it thinks is correct even though it’s not. I’m finding it interesting.

So here, we put it into chat and chat says the correct answer is the correct answer. That’s the free version.

Okay. So here, I’ve put the same question into Dr. Google using Ctrl+F. Now, it’s hard to do that because I usually have pictures of the questions on the multiple choice. So, you’re committing an academic offense. You’re also having to retype the question because I’ve taken a picture of it. Not on all of them, but most of them that I think you might try to Ctrl+F on, and that’s an academic offense.

So here, I put it into Google and of course Google gave me some different URLs. So I got distracted and I’m spending more than two minutes on this question trying to figure it out, when I could have just read it, thought about it, and realized that it’s B.

So, my warning once again is: it is an academic, scholastic offense, and I insert images of the actual questions to prevent cheating. So, the question is photographed. If you attempt to use Google, you will be forced to retype the question manually.

But I’m not really worried about Google at all. I’m worried about chat. And here what I want to mention to you is: let’s say you have not opened any of the lectures on Brightspace and then you use chat to answer all the questions and you’re at home alone and nobody can see you. Someday we will figure out how to catch you and that will be considered an academic offense and you will someday be caught. It might, it’ll probably not be on my exam because it’s too early in the life of ChatGPT, but we have a committee and we’re figuring out things, and basically all I can tell you is you will be expelled from any university in Canada for cheating.

If it’s continual cheating, the SRBA will expel you. And I’ve been on the SRBA and I’ve seen that happen. It’s pretty upsetting. People end up having to leave Canada. Their visa, one guy I remember, had to go back to Saudi Arabia. His family lost all their money and he kept appealing, trying to get us to change our minds. And no, we didn’t. Anyway, do not risk your academic future.

Remember, I am not trying to trick you. My questions are not trying to trick you. Sometimes students will sit there and they’ll go, “Oh, well, is she trying to trick me?” You know, maybe it’s not that common-sense answer and so on. No. Just take your time. Read the question and answers a few times. Eliminate the answers that are obviously incorrect and choose the one that you think, in your gut, is the right answer.

Now, I want to warn you to protect your notes. If you use Quizlet or you use notes that you put online, other students may find them to be outdated or incorrect because I update my lectures every term. A lot of the old notes that I look at on Quizlet are amazingly outdated. You know, they might talk about NAFTA or something like that.

Once I emailed a student because her notes were so poor and so hastily written that they were misleading students. They were getting lower marks. I was sure of it. So I emailed her and it turned out she was hiking in Nepal and she didn’t realize that Quizlet had saved her notes because that’s its default. Quizlet takes all the notes and default saves them. So she actually was so upset. I remember she hiked for three days back to a Wi-Fi place and then, as soon as she’d removed her note, she emailed me from wherever it was in Nepal.

So, do not risk your notes being used by others to cheat, and take responsibility for what you share online. The ones that are selling the notes with the questions, I just laugh because there’s literally 5,000 questions. So, how could you have gotten them? You don’t have them.

The quickest way to study is to listen to the lecture one time and then review the slides one time. You don’t have to listen to the lecture again, but you should listen to it once.

Now my issue is, of course, now the new Brightspace, you have to shorten all the lecture titles. I used to have the question always have the lecture title, but now they want only 50 characters, which means I have to rewrite everything. I’m not sure I’m going to have time to do that, to rewrite the whole thing.

But anyway, here’s a sample question from 1B, 2135 on Canada’s foreign policy, liberal internationalism. I’m not obligated to put the whole lesson in. I can just put what the name was.

What was the primary focus of Lester Bison’s Temple University? Okay, so this is a bit of a harder, challenging question. And so you just read all the answers.

And then I think, on this point, um, I randomly pushes, the questions are linear but the answers are also randomized. They’re randomized. So what was correct before was C, but now what is correct is A. So that means that if someone’s writing beside you, they’d say A is correct. Well, you don’t know what A, your A is different.

Okay. Now your friends will receive different questions, different answers, and the question pool is very large. So it is unlikely you will receive the same question twice.

It’s an academic offense to ask your friend to write the exam again because they got a high score and you didn’t study. That’s an academic offense and your friend will also be expelled if it is found out that you did that.

So let’s say your friend took the quiz three times and they took, I mean, they have literally at that point answered 120 questions. The pools are not large enough for you not to encounter the same questions, or him or her, whoever it is that you bribe to do that. So it is really a bad idea.

You should really try and take the quiz three times because it really helps you to figure out the questions and answers, and it helps you to study. It really helps you. That’s what it’s meant to do. It’s meant to help you.

Okay. PowerPoint slides are available, including one set from the speaker Walter Dorne in lesson six.

Let me mention that all Brightspace can monitor whether students have opened windows and when. WTS technicians and I can see if you’ve opened the course site and at what time and what date.

Many students have not opened the course yet. Only a few are asking about course regulations, like where is the quiz or the exam date in the course regulations. The answer, of course, is in the course calendar, and the chatbot also tells you the dates.

Let me mention that I’m not going to be using that. I don’t. There’s an extra supplementary video I’ve done on my reasoning for that.

Following the call for the creation of a UN peacekeeping force for Rwanda, no countries. So the answer would be zero.

A lot of the questions are easily, you can work your way through it if you listen to the lecture one time at high speed, or if you’ve listened to it a couple of times.

I think that the exam is very easy. My best advice is to think it through. You do not need to study every word and concept that we explain.

Relax and use your very powerful brain to figure out the right answers. Your best ally is your mind and not your notes.

You’re not allowed to use another screen. You’re not allowed to go to another device like your phone to use Google or chat. Your best ally is your own very intelligent brain.

So, good luck.

I’ve given you another example here to think it through. I really think this is a very easy question. You do not need to study every word and concept that I explained to figure out that the right answer is C.

Let me show that picture. That student would be committing a scholastic offense in my class. That’s because they’re consulting another screen and their notes. If you consult another screen during the midterm or the final exam, you have committed a scholastic offense and it will rest on your conscience.

Let me finally add that I have many supplementary lectures. I’ve recently added one on the UN, one on Brightspace and its limitations, the problems with how it’s measuring. It does not accurately measure time spent on lectures or the use of library tools.

I added one on how to travel the world with Dr. Britain.

In short, those supplementary lectures are there for your interest and your enrichment, but they are not on the exam.

I am not a medical professional.

There are also lectures on how to overcome anxiety, fear, how to overcome fear of public speaking, perfectionism, but these are suggestions only and are not examinable.

Finally, try to quell your brain’s anxiety by putting anxiety into a relaxing chair based on the movie.

Put a list on your fridge or in your pocket of your favorite activities and call this your extreme self-care list.

Every day, do at least one thing on your list in order to deal with the inevitable anxiety that is experienced by everyone.

Thank you for listening.
