Really we need to stand up and be proud about this. Okay, so Canadians, we have mantras that have become the proved working language of the federal government pictured here. I used to live right where that Canadian flag is and I used to look out at the uh Parliament Hill, walk my dogs on the that's the it's the Gatineau Outaouais side, the the Hull side. Uh so anyway, the working language, the mantras is of the sustainable development goals. Until you go to the United Nations and until you go to Ottawa, you don't realize how embedded this SDGs are in their way of thinking. Okay. To end here this lecture, a digital movement map of Canadian organizations, NGOs and so on identifies almost 12,000 civil society groups that work on the SDGs. 12,000 different organizations in Canada that are working toward a resilient common future. That's an astounding number of people who are volunteering to work toward this vision. Uh so I do have a supplementary lecture in the supplementary lectures if you want to take a look at it on voluntary organizations that you could work for. I highly suggest volunteering even if it's for just a week during your February uh break. volunteer for an organization for free if you can and maybe they like you and as I explained in that lecture once show some commitment to their cause to their to their vision to their shared uh tasks they may actually uh find some money and hire you with a short-term summer position or a position over the next few years. Who knows? So work toward what you're passionate about and I'm certain that you will get and and obtain a really good career. Thank you for listening.
