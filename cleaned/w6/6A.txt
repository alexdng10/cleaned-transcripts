**Lecture on the Emergence of Global Governance**

Welcome to the lesson on the emergence of global governance. As you can tell, we're going to be going through a lot of information in preparation for a very special guest, Dr. Walter Dorne.

In my last lecture, I suggested that Canada should place armed troops along the longest undefended border in the world, and that would arguably slash a psychological wound between Canada and the United States. I also suggested a made-in-Canada peacekeeping operation.

If we think back to the emergence of COVID, it shut the Canada-US border down completely. But it was the speed with which leaders of historically friendly countries agreed to go their separate ways that left indelible scars.

President Trump's threats to annex Canada as the 51st US state and to impose 25% trade tariffs are undermining the trust between Canadians and Americans, and leading many Canadians — and even Americans — to buy Canadian. We're hearing that many Canadian goods, including Arva Mills in London, Ontario, are being inundated with requests. What will happen next?

Under the pressure of a tiny virus, our paths diverged and our common US border widened. But the announcements by President Trump since the inauguration on January 20th, 2025 are creating more division rather than unity. As our economies become more strained and our healthcare systems are tested on both sides, the world cannot help but bear witness to growing divisions.

There is fear about President Trump's suggestion to move 2.1 million Palestinians out of their ancestral grounds in the Gaza Strip to ready it for a US takeover — what could amount to an ethnic cleansing. Despite centuries of living in Palestine, the threat is there.

So this lecture discusses global governance and the United Nations in the wake of the COVID pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and now American threats to take over Canada, Greenland, the Panama Canal, and the Gaza Strip, as well as the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America," which is already being reflected in American maps. This lecture also takes place in the context of deportations.

**COVID-19: Deaths and Public Opinion**

According to Worldometer — a URL provided in the extra notes — more than 1 million people, exactly 1,090,082, in the United States succumbed to COVID as of October 2022. Canada lost 45,689 people, a much smaller number and a smaller rate of 843 people per million. Canada's health system and its rigorous standards — closing borders, cities, and institutions like this university — meant a significantly lower death rate.

Public opinion in the United States was marked by negative ratings of presidents and deep political divisions, with few having confidence in either President Trump or his successor President Biden during the pandemic. Curiously, Prime Minister Trudeau's popularity increased dramatically during the pandemic, with almost two-thirds of Canadians approving of his handling of the virus. That's quite a switch from now, when he has recently resigned after nine years as prime minister and will not be running again.

Looking back, his liberal internationalism and evidence-based feminist approach was marked by cooperation and level-headed thinking. That feminist approach is still being followed at Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa. However, Trudeau resigned under a cloud, partly seen as anti-feminist following the abrupt and surprising resignation of his Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Freeland ran for the Liberal leadership against Mark Carney — former Bank of Canada Governor — and others including Karina Gould. Freeland lost, and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who had been widely expected to become Prime Minister, lost the election including his own seat, leading to Carney's minority government.

**Canada-US Relations and Global Governance**

Canada-US relations are being judged in the court of both domestic and international public opinion. People are watching how both countries handle COVID's aftermath, tariffs, and the new administration's rapid-fire announcements.

During his first term in February 2021, Donald Trump proposed slashing 21% of foreign aid. Now in 2025, he has cut all of it and is attempting to fire all USAID federal employees — though a judge has temporarily blocked that. In contrast, Canada very quietly announced $159.5 million in humanitarian aid to a range of organizations including the Red Cross, UNICEF, and Gavi, the vaccine alliance. The question is: will Canada step up and spend even more on humanitarian aid?

During the pandemic, President Trump withheld more than $400 million from the World Health Organization, claiming it had a Chinese bias. Now he is trying to withdraw the United States from the WHO entirely. Canada, by contrast, paid its dues and voluntarily increased its contribution by millions. We certainly cannot make up for the US cuts, but it is instructive to contrast the two different approaches to global governance and international institutions.

During the pandemic, Trump also threatened to ban the export of personal protective equipment — gloves, masks, and so on — including to neighboring Canada. We forget how many threats there were back then.

I want to draw your attention to Karina Gould. At the time, as Minister of International Development, she stepped up greatly to help convene the international Group of Friends on Food and Nutrition Security. I remember thinking at the time: who is this very young Member of Parliament confronting all of this and standing up in the House of Commons saying we're going to spend more to alleviate a hunger pandemic?

She was a Liberal leadership hopeful — just 37 years old, the youngest candidate in the race. She wanted to cut the federal sales tax and lower the GST by 4%. She was ultimately unable to raise the funds needed to mount a full leadership campaign, and Freeland lost to Mark Carney.

The province of Ontario also held an early election, re-electing Doug Ford with a majority government. These municipal, federal, and provincial elections are a good opportunity for students to observe and invigilate elections — experience that could prepare you to help monitor foreign elections, perhaps for the United Nations.

Perhaps most indicative of America's growing isolationism and Canada's increasing solidarity with the community of nations was a proposal at the UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire — asking all nations to stop armed conflict while humanity faced the common threat of COVID-19. It was an international call for common sense, and the United States was the lone voice of opposition, vetoing the ceasefire proposal.

COVID remains a global threat. The most recent revelation, tweeted by Elon Musk — so reliability is uncertain — was that the United States was intentionally funding research at the Wuhan lab in China. This is confusing on its face: why would the US fund research at a Chinese lab that could be used against the US? It may simply be confusion, because the CIA announced just days ago that the Wuhan lab leak theory is now considered the most likely source of COVID. The CIA is reporting it was likely not a natural virus from an animal black market, but a virus that escaped from a Chinese military lab due to poor laboratory protocol. When I circulated this information to the international Pugwash movement, someone wrote to me that it was racist to say so — but why would identifying a lab leak be racist? The fact of the matter is that neither China, the United States, nor Russia follow proper protocol, and it is sadly inevitable that viruses will continue to escape and spread around the world.

**The Path Forward: Global Governance and the SDGs**

What is our path forward toward health, well-being, and a more virus-free world? It is linked to many other global challenges: poverty, food insecurity, human insecurity, and climate change. None of these problems can be tackled alone — no country, no person can solve them. We need a united path forward.

This has been eloquently laid out by the UN in what's called Agenda 2030, more commonly referred to as the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. I'm wearing my SDG brooch today — you can buy scarves, pins, and all sorts of items symbolizing your commitment to the SDGs. There are 17 goals in total.

These are visionary goals. They are not going to be fully achieved by 2030, or in our lifetimes, or even our grandchildren's lifetimes. But they are a vision of how we can live together peacefully as humankind on planet Earth. People often say, "Well, if they're not going to happen, why bother?" — but they are a vision to work toward. You'll see many UN delegates wearing the SDG colors, and when you do, you know you share those goals.

The goals include clean water for the world — there is currently no clean water at all in the Gaza Strip — no poverty, decent work, economic growth, climate action, preserving the world's oceans, and what I'm focusing on today: strong institutions, global governance, and the emergence of international institutions.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has appealed for accelerated change in this decade of action toward 2030. It is a common path forward that desperately needs world leaders whose vocabulary champions words like "together" and "solidarity," rather than words of division. Canada officially champions the SDGs, and this university is ranked at the top in Canada — and I believe in the world — for commitment to the SDGs. Our president has been among the most vocal advocates. That's why you see the posters everywhere, and we should be very proud of that.

The SDGs have become a working language and mantra of the Canadian federal government. Until you go to the United Nations or to Ottawa, you don't realize how deeply embedded the SDGs are in how people think and work.

**Closing Remarks**

To close, a digital movement map of Canadian organizations identifies almost 12,000 civil society groups working on the SDGs — 12,000 different organizations across Canada working toward a resilient, common future. That is an astounding number of people volunteering toward this vision.

I do have a supplementary lecture on voluntary organizations if you'd like to explore that further. I highly suggest volunteering — even just for a week during your February break. Volunteer for free, show your commitment to their cause and their shared tasks, and they may well find the money to hire you for a summer position or something longer term. Work toward what you're passionate about, and I'm certain you will build a truly meaningful career.

Thank you for listening.
