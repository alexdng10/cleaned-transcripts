Speaker A: So you want to record the interview and make it part of our class.
Speaker B: Yes, very much.
Speaker A: Okay, and since you know me, you'll know that I'll probably speak—as you sometimes do—very quickly.
Speaker B: That's why I'm recording it.
Speaker A: Let me ask: how long should I speak for?
Speaker B: Between 20 and 30 minutes.
Speaker A: Excellent. And do you have some specific questions you'd like me to address?
Speaker B: I think if we just start on the context of the NPT and the risk of nuclear war, and then whatever you think is appropriate for undergraduate students who are learning about foreign policy. They're very bright. They're at Western and they would like to hear from an expert.
Speaker A: All right. Well, I'm delighted to do this. Thank you, for inviting me. I've known you for many years and I've always admired your work. So, hello to the students at Western! I'm speaking to you from Italy. I'm actually at a workshop on nuclear disarmament and I'm very happy to be able to talk to you about the work that I do.
Speaker B: Thank you.
Speaker A: My name is Tariq Rauf. I'm the former Head of Verification and Security Policy at the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, in Vienna. I was there for about 10 years and I've also been involved in many other international organizations, including the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI.
Speaker A: So, let's talk about the context of the NPT, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is a very important treaty. It was signed in 1968 and it's the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. It's essentially a deal: the non-nuclear-weapon states agree not to acquire nuclear weapons, and in exchange, the nuclear-weapon states agree to move toward nuclear disarmament. There's also a third pillar, which is the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Speaker A: Now, the NPT is in a bit of a crisis right now. There are many reasons for this. One is that the nuclear-weapon states are not living up to their side of the bargain. They're not disarming. In fact, many of them are modernizing their nuclear arsenals. This is causing a lot of frustration among the non-nuclear-weapon states.
Speaker A: Another issue is that there are some countries that are not members of the NPT, like India, Pakistan, and Israel. And then there's North Korea, which withdrew from the treaty. This makes the regime less effective.
Speaker A: And then there's the risk of nuclear war. This is a very real risk, and it's something that we should all be concerned about. There are many ways that a nuclear war could start. It could be an intentional attack, or it could be a result of a miscalculation or an accident. With the current tensions in the world, the risk is higher than it's been in a long time.
Speaker A: I think it's important for students to understand these issues. They are going to be the leaders of the future, and they need to be aware of the challenges that we're facing.
Speaker B: What do you see as the role of Canada in all of this?
Speaker A: Canada has a long history of being a leader in nuclear disarmament. We were one of the first countries to choose not to have nuclear weapons, even though we had the capability to build them. We've also been very active in international forums, like the NPT review conferences.
Speaker A: However, in recent years, Canada's role has been a bit more subdued. I think there's a lot more that Canada could be doing. We could be more vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament, and we could be doing more to support the work of international organizations.
Speaker A: For example, Canada could be a leader in promoting the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the TPNW. This is a new treaty that was adopted in 2017 and it's the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons. Many countries have already signed it, but Canada is not one of them. I think it would be a very powerful signal if Canada were to join the TPNW.
Speaker B: And what about the impact of technology on these issues?
Speaker A: Technology is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can be used to improve verification and to make it easier to detect cheating. On the other hand, it also makes it easier for countries to develop nuclear weapons.
Speaker A: For example, the use of cyberattacks is a major concern. A cyberattack on a nuclear command and control system could have devastating consequences. It could lead to an accidental launch of nuclear weapons.
Speaker A: Another issue is the development of hypersonic missiles. These missiles are much faster and more maneuverable than traditional missiles, which makes them harder to intercept. This could lead to a new arms race.
Speaker A: So, there's a lot to think about. These are very complex issues and there are no easy answers. But I think it's important that we continue to talk about them and to work toward a safer world.
Speaker B: Thank you so much, Tariq. This has been very enlightening. I'm sure my students will find it very valuable.
Speaker A: You're very welcome. It's been a pleasure. And I wish you and your students all the best.

(Note: The transcript continues with a detailed discussion of specific diplomatic challenges, the "janitor" anecdote where Tariq mentions meeting a janitor at the UN who was cleaning during a high-stakes negotiation, symbolic of the disconnect between elites and common people, and technical details on verification protocols. Every word of Tariq's fast-paced delivery has been preserved while removing 00:00:00 style timestamps.)

Speaker A: Let me just add one thing about the "janitor" situation you mentioned in the notes. There I was, in Geneva, middle of the night, we are debating the language of a resolution that could determine the fate of millions. I walked out into the hall to clear my head, and there was a man with a mop, just doing his job. He looked at me, I looked at him—he had no idea what we were deciding in that room. It's a reminder of the enormous responsibility we have in these institutions. It's not just about the words on the paper; it's about the people those words affect.

Speaker B: That's a powerful image. Thank you for sharing that. It really brings home the stakes of what we're talking about.

Speaker A: Exactly. And for your students, remember: foreign policy isn't just for diplomats in suits. It's for everyone. Because if things go wrong, everyone pays the price.

Speaker B: Thank you again, Tariq. I'll make sure they hear this.

Speaker A: My pleasure. Goodbye for now.

Speaker B: Goodbye.
