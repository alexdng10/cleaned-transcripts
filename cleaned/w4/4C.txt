### Transcript 4C

A little bit about him and um, sorry, it's telling me that the recording is in progress uh right now. I'm not certain if I'm allowed to divulge your current position but he a few weeks ago was the senior advisor to the Minister of Defense of Afghanistan and he graduated with his PhD last August from our department, the political science department at the University of Western Ontario. So this event is also co-sponsored by our department. Our department is in a retreat today so they could not come, which is a long story. Saki Nampour specializes in international security policy and NATO-led capacity building initiatives. He's also a registered business executive member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and you can reach him by Gmail. My name is Erica Simpson and I'm also a speaker here and so I prepared a video for about 15 minutes for people here and we're going to play that first I think and then that will help, you'll see I recorded it. I had to record it before May 7th so I recorded it in the wake of NATO and the uh Germany and Italy and the United States announcements that they would uh withdraw from Afghanistan. So I'm not sure if the room monitor, can you flip on the, the um recording?

Hi everyone, my name is Erica Simpson and I'm introducing myself today actually so if you don't mind I'll I'll share a screen and uh so I have a PhD in that made from the University of Toronto and I'm an associate professor of IR at Western University and I'm also the president and program chair of the Canadian Peace Research Association. So my main research interests are in International Security and North American foreign and defense policy, particularly Arms Control, disarmament, nuclear issues, nuclear waste and peacekeeping in Afghanistan and also in Canada. I have written a book "NATO and the Bomb" and many other articles that have appeared in various journals, some of them listed there, including most recently the Brown Journal of World Politics. I'm a national syndicated columnist for Postmedia and also I write a regular column for The Hill Times. Uh, what else can I tell you about? I serve as a director on the board of the Canadian Pugwash Group and then I'm an invited consultant and peer reviewer for various things. I was formerly a Fellow, Alton Jones Fellow, Barton Fellow and Liu Institute Fellow, NATO Fellow and Treasurer and Vice Chair of the Canadian Pugwash Group. So in 2015 I'm very proud that the Voice of Women awarded me the Shirley Farlinger Lifetime Achievement Award for peace writings.

So I'm going to be talking to you today about Afghanistan and I was hoping uh to just introduce you some of the problems and the dilemmas of Afghanistan. So I'll just share another screen with you and we will go through my PowerPoint together quickly. Okay, so Afghanistan, and I'll just, I'd like to use the laser pointer, give me a second, highlighter and there we are. Okay, so I will be speaking on Wednesday June the 2nd from 10:00 to 10:30 a.m. and I hope to bring in a special guest who I want to tell you a little bit more about in a few moments.

So the conflict in Afghanistan is one of the bloodiest in the world and it's the tenacity of the Taliban, ISIS or ISIL and the Al-Qaeda network that mean that the country cannot continue uh without to operate without help from NATO. So often barrages of rockets hit the heavily fortified Green Zone where many embassies and international firms are based in the capital of Kabul. So the number that are killed every day is unclear but for example in November last year 22 people were killed and 27 were wounded when three ISIS-affiliated gunmen rampaged through Kabul University spraying classrooms with bullets for several hours. So now that the United States and NATO have decided to entirely withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11th, observers and Afghans are worried about attacks on the city's universities, the single international airport and also on the fortified Green Zone. Nobody knows why these attacks are carried out, whether it's to pressure or defame or make the government look weak in front of its citizens or to strengthen positions at various uh bargaining tables. However, the debate at NATO continues to be whether it was short-sighted for the incoming U.S. Administration under President Joe Biden to entirely first decide to drastically reduce then entirely eliminate by September the number of American troops in Afghanistan this year.

The NATO allies are all following the United States lead and they have all decided to withdraw by September 11th. So the risk is high that insurgents pinktured here take over and the country becomes a strategic holding ground for the world's wealthiest and most lethal terrorist groups. The intra-Afghan negotiations here, pictured here with the Taliban and elected governments' representatives, were tasked in September 2020 to find a long-term agreement, but the two-sided talks that aim to end literally decades of war have accomplished very little and are stalled in Doha, Qatar. The army is underprepared and the police force to conduct a sustained campaign against the adversaries attacking in the rural areas pictured here. Afghan forces will need rigorous Security Sector Reform, which means more discipline and professionalization due in part to the army's corruption and its drug use. What is Security Sector Reform (SSR)? The air-to-ground integration capability and the Afghan Air Force's A-29s given to them by the United States are proving sufficient, but a new city-by-city defense plan needs a assiduous implementation here. So here you can see the ground troops and the preparation of the National Army.

The NATO-led Resolute Support Mission or RSM was launched in 2015 and it was launched after ISAF ended in 2014. So RSM provides training, advice, and assistance and that will end its mission and withdraw by September. So approximately 12,000 personnel from 30 NATO member states and eight partner countries have been deployed in RSM and they are operating in a non-combat mission from one central haven, Kabul, with spokes in four directions. The NATO Secretary General, here is NATO headquarters in Brussels uh and that's the the 30 uh flags of the 30 countries remain committed they say to Afghanistan despite ending RSM and the United States separate combat mission which is Operation Freedom's Sentinel. So the separate contingent of U.S. forces participated in force protection, in logistical support and counter-terrorism activities and this is according to various reports.

Do you think that the United States should have remained in Afghanistan and for how much longer? Do you think they should remain another 21 years, another four years until November? You may want to reflect at this point upon the implications of long-term involvement. However, please pay attention uh to the pictures taken by Dr. Saki Nampour here. He is the senior advisor to the Minister of Defense in Afghanistan and he successfully defended his PhD dissertation on SSR under my supervision in August 2020 and departed the next day for Afghanistan where he's on the war front. And I'm hoping to bring him in by military satellite phone from the war front in June. He just texted me uh he just literally texted me on my phone and there might be some interesting issues in that regard. Saki and his boss the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, were taken by surprise in April just like me because we thought that the United States would undertake a conditions-based withdrawal and that this would last perhaps until the end of November and then at that point the United States would pause its troop reductions and reassess the situation. This was certainly indicated by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. But Esper was fired by President Donald Trump on November 10th and that upended the military leadership and led to the appointment of Christopher Miller as the acting secretary. So Miller announced on November 17th the drawdown of troops from 4,500 to 2,500 U.S. service members in Afghanistan and he also announced the drawdown from 3,000 to 2,500 in Iraq.

So the non-U.S. allies in Afghanistan, especially Germany in the north and Italy which is deployed in the western Herat Province bordering Iran, decided to remain. Indeed the German government warned U.S. administrators that the plan partial withdrawal of American troops risked putting peace and progress in the country in danger. So here you can see the German foreign ministry spokesperson Christopher Burger stating that premature withdrawal could jeopardize the negotiation process, the two-sided one between the Afghan government and the Taliban, and jeopardize the progress achieved so far in Afghanistan. So that was a strong statement, but once Biden decided to get out of Afghanistan, Germany followed its lead. At its peak the German mission included 5,000 German troops and now a total of nearly 1,100 German soldiers are being withdrawn from Afghanistan by September. Italy had sent over 4,000 troops to fight against terrorism since 2009. Italy it seems has 895 that will be deployed that will be pulled out and part of the concern there relates to Iran's alleged support to the Taliban. So that meant that NATO saw sustaining the Italian deployment as important. The missions in the United States and in the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq are receiving very scant attention. Um, the United States also has about 700 troops in Somalia and and they are and they were seen as important cornerstones of global efforts to combat terrorism. So a global pullback some argue means that future U.S. administrations, Democratic or Republican, could enter office burdened by unsolvable problems that are exacerbated by overhasty and irresponsible decision making right now.

Thank you. So here you can see the the very pivotal April 2021 uh decision on April 14th and here you can see the United States announcing and the allies, the foreign ministers and the defense ministers that consulted by Zoom um or and following a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the U.S. Secretary of State and they announced that all troops would vacate Afghanistan before September 11th, before the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. So the U.S. withdrawal was portrayed by the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as an accomplishment of America's goals. However, those goals were from the outset ambiguous and now their clarity is lost in the in the annals of time. What we do know and what is certain is that President Joe Biden was insistent that U.S. troops would completely withdraw from the quagmire, meaning from the muddy mess, and the NATO allies immediately followed the United States hegemon's lead. So I'm using that word hegemon to describe the U.S. hegemony for this sudden decision. Here you can see NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on that day saying, "our drawdown will be orderly, coordinated and deliberate," adding that "we are united in leaving together," which is putting a bold and a brave face on the decision.

So is this a new chapter? The news the uh Blinken went straight the next day to Afghanistan and met with the Afghanistan government signaling a new chapter in the country's relationship, but that news was relegated to the margins of the world's newspapers because of the prospect of a different brewing war in Central Europe and this is over and in the context of Russia's mounting troop deployment next to Ukraine and NATO exercises in Ukraine and Ukraine's fears that Russia could potentially store nuclear weapons in Crimea. So the allies, France and NATO ally Germany, turned to that crisis. Ukraine is not a NATO ally but they turn to urge Russia to withdraw its troops at the Ukraine border. So everyone focused on that crisis and Afghanistan fell by the wayside.

Thank you. We have to look at the fact that the United States is war-weary, their coffers are bare after military expenditures of nearly one trillion dollars on on Iraq and on Afghanistan and another 44 billion on reconstruction projects that may in the future—we don't know what will happen if the Taliban uh take over—but certainly the United States is facing unprecedented catastrophic costs from COVID-related health concerns. So who could really blame President Biden for wanting to get out of Afghanistan after 20 tumultuous and very painful years? So here's some pictures taken from Saki from the war front and you can see that they're preparing night vision goggles and carrying things and preparing their weapons. The United States has endured thousands of combat-related deaths and PTSD injuries and the cost for 970,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans' disability claims is going to become much larger over time, exponentially larger. Meanwhile, in the Afghanistan's president's presidential palace, here's President Ghani pinktured here. He seems to be holed up in the palace seeking or seeing junior aides who allow him to think that completing a second term would somehow cement his legacy. And we also can't forget former President Hamid Karzai who is waiting in the wings in the hope that a transfer of power will lead to a sea change in Afghanistan's fortunes. So here you can see a picture that Saki took of the troops.

Because the moving chess pieces will not change the fundamentals of Afghanistan's strategic situation. It's caught in these vast planes, mountains, among moving war-men intent on grabbing resources and usurping the authority such that, in my view, the Taliban's sons will be replaced by their grandsons raised in a culture of war and unable to countenance even the prospect of any kinds of concessions. The women in Afghanistan—it is widely feared that women and girls will suffer the most from gender inequality. They already do, especially in the rural areas outside the cities of Kabul and Kandahar. Global Affairs did a survey and reported that 51% of Afghan women reported lifetime physical and sexual intimate partner violence. The rate of child marriage was 35%. Unbelievable. And over 70% of females 15 and older are illiterate, they cannot read. That is compared to 44% of males, shockingly high. Canada has a 99% literacy rate.

So what are some solutions? We're not going to hear much from the women and children in Afghanistan again as the Taliban captures more ground from the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) because they're commanded by old men pinktured here who have given up any prospect of winning. It will be left up to the next generation, probably three generations from now, to agree upon some kind of solutions that involve disarmament, some kind of arms verification and monitoring, local and also international multilateral negotiations. There will also have to be some kind of enforcement and a legislative end to indiscriminate bombing and there has to be among all sides renewed openness to electoral power sharing as well as elements of Taliban ideology will have to be mixed somehow with secular principles. All these related pillars of security in my view could collapse around shackled and abandoned in a country with the world's lowest per capita GDP and some of the world's lowest literacy ratings. So RSM was committed to training and funding the Afghan Security Forces and it might have stayed with the conditions-based approach, but in the end once President Biden rejected such thinking, you can see here at the press conference the preferred entire Alliance option became total withdrawal.

Hopeless and yet from the very beginning the entire enterprise was doomed to failure because Al-Qaeda and its nefarious cells can jump from one desperate countryside in Afghanistan to Somalia to Mali to another conflicted area. So the best way to defeat Al-Qaeda back in 2001 would have been to set up counter-intelligence spying and secret surveillance systems. That's my view. And according to U.S. intelligence officials that is still possible, indeed easier after building a network of informers and spies in Afghanistan for the last 20 years. Nevertheless for the Pentagon and the intelligence community, a key debate right now is whether counter-terrorism operations can be maintained from outside Afghanistan. For Americans worried about the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, when you look at the actual statistics, COVID-related deaths, car crashes and suicide are far more significant causes of death. However, it is sad to contemplate the impact on Afghans once the United States and NATO entirely withdraw and I think we could see an increasing stream of Afghans and civilians trying to get to the international airport as it is closed and so this will be reminiscent of Saigon in 1975 before it fell to the North Vietnamese Army.

I've invited some other speakers on Afghanistan, Rory O'Connor also a former graduate student of mine who uh ended up—can you can you stop the uh Federal Public Service? You can stop now, um, yeah you can stop thank you. Um, so I want to now turn to uh Dr. Nampour who I see has been writing notes and I'm hoping that uh he can respond or can speak to us now, thank you.

Well thank you Erica, am I audible? I'm sorry if my internet connection it could be a little spotty I'm talking to you all the way from Kandahar Airfield. Um well it's great to be here. Um as we understand the Security Sector Reform process in Afghanistan has been a long journey, something that was hailed as a panacea for emerging democratic countries such as Afghanistan. Very many tribulations, very many challenges still exist uh the complexities are only being compounded with the withdrawal of NATO forces and the U.S. forces from Afghanistan. So there's a few things that I want to touch upon, Dr. Simpson has touched upon some very important and interesting facts so I want to start about what state are we in currently. Currently in Afghanistan we're in the transformative phase, so this is the time where we're actually actively working on decentralization of security apparatuses, meaning giving a lot of local police militia such as the Afghan Local Police, District Police and police commanders in different provinces all across Afghanistan, namely the 34 provinces that we have, a greater autonomy to listen to people uh to understand what is really needed in these districts. Our issue currently is that with the withdrawal of U.S. forces, yes we do control the major urban centers in Afghanistan but we cannot get to the districts. The rural districts for the most part are totally controlled by the Taliban. We are on the front lines with them, but the problem is that we do not have the air superiority that we enjoyed for the past 20 years uh the Afghan Air Force is gravely under-equipped, underfunded and very minuscule compared to the uh might of the U.S. forces when they were providing us with full support.

Um so in essence we're taking this approach of the second generation of SSR. So just to kind of highlight over it, the second generation of Security Sector Reform essentially instead of just having a rigid and concrete form of policy to push government policy from top-down, we kind of are taking the bottom-up approach where we are involving community activists, grassroots movements, civil society in our decision-making process. We are trying to see exactly what is needed to improve security outcomes in areas under our control. And this is something new, it will take time, and especially with the withdrawal of U.S. forces right now this issue is only getting more and more complex. Um the capabilities of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, we are very capable in terms of defending the territory that we do have. I know right now all over you know social media or global news networks and outlets they're talking about the potential fall of the Kabul Administration uh one thing we can assure them that Kabul Administration will not fall. We are very much able to defend our provinces and our capital city and make and ensure the security of our diplomatic staffs. We have very many great security arrangements in place.

Um in my capacity as advisor until a couple weeks ago we had set up some very many um robust plans which included the interception of threats and how to uh make sure the metropolis of Kabul where over six and a half million people call it their home that it is secure from very many uh security threats. Of course as you can see a lot of cowardly attacks do take place all across Afghanistan especially in the Kabul, you know what we call soft targets targeting children targeting schools and this is something that goes against every single human value uh all across the world. So that is one thing that we're talking about, the fall of the administration is not imminent and it will not fall. Will there be complexities in the peace negotiations that are currently going on with Taliban? Absolutely. Our position in the government is that these peace negotiations went a little—essentially it's a stalling tactic until the United States withdraws, until the Taliban um draws upon their full capabilities to launch a full-scale civil war against us. Um there's very many foreign intelligence agencies which are involved, we have credible intelligence day in day out where we do see who's supporting them. The solution to Afghanistan for a large part does lie in Pakistan and Pakistan is a unique case because we see in other countries where a state has a military, in Afghanistan we have a state, we have the Afghan National Security Forces. Pakistan is a unique case because the government essentially wields no power over the military and in Pakistan the military has a state where you see them controlling all aspects of foreign policy, all aspects of uh their intelligence gathering techniques and their influence is quite vast.

So as such any solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and to improve our Security Sector Reform agenda essentially needs Pakistan's partnership. How sincere is their approach? We do not know. When they wanted to have two professors released from captivity, it did not take them long to have them released. Once the Pakistani government that was reached out to the military and the Taliban released them in a matter of couple days, so we do know that they wield considerable influence over them. So the Peace and Reconciliation process that I've been talking about, it is very much in our opinion still a stalling tactic. The red line for the Afghan government, our position is that we will not acquiesce to the Taliban and sacrifice the hard-earned rights that we have earned for women, for children, access to education, democratic reform. Um the electoral process, we will not go back to the Stone Ages again and we will not let presidents and dignitaries be dragged on the streets of Kabul and hung by a pole for the public to watch. This will not happen again and we will not allow that.

Um the outlook as of now, given the current security situation, is that we expect to have a stalemate. Um and and there's a reason why I say that. The United States, they're withdrawing. We have 352,000 security forces under our command and we're very capable of protecting the areas that we do have, but we lack the logistical support, we lack the reconnaissance support. And it's like the NATO and the U.S., we're very grateful to them for what they have supported us for over the past 21 years but it feels as if we're all of a sudden abandoned in the middle of this conflict where it's only getting worse. And this is not—and this is probably in the past 21 years this is the worst point of the conflict. In the past 21 years there hasn't been a single point in time where the conflict was worse than what it is today and we're being abandoned at a time where we definitely do need the international support. But we are again, we're ready for all eventualities, uh we had prepared for this and again we do appreciate their political, moral and financial support but the capacity building and combat support on the field is something that money can't buy and it's something that political support and rhetorical rhetoric can't be changed.

So as of now our position is very much that we will be in a stalemate. Our aim is for the next—for this fighting season which is going to be starting later this month, which the Taliban usually they release a media uh release that they have started off their fighting season. Our goal is to prevent most of these attacks and perhaps push them to their districts, but it is proving difficult. It has proven to be something where we see a lot of foreign fighters who are infiltrating Afghanistan right now. We have credible intelligence that there are plans to bring in a lot of foreign fighters once the United States leaves and that is going to be facilitated through the borders of Pakistan and Iran. And how we intercept them and how we prevent Al-Qaeda from taking a foothold on Afghan territory is another challenge that we're going to be dealing with. Um so as of now, the Security Sector Reform has taken on this image where it actually comes down to what have we accomplished over the past 21 years or 20 and a half years? And this will be borne out by evidence and the performance of Afghan troops. And what we are expecting is that the morale and the discipline of the security institutions will hold. We will make sure there are elections again, we will make sure that the access to education, women's rights and all these other democratic successes which we have had, such as having all these institutions access to these institutions—um but these positive values will remain and prevail for years to come.

But and in spite of all this, you know, kind of uh government release that I'm telling you about and you know I do not mean to sound like a government mouthpiece who's extremely optimistic, I'm also kind of pointing out the challenges that we do have. And the challenges we do have will be something that will be witnessed in the field and in our opinion the United States will have no choice but to re-engage Afghanistan. They will have no choice to re-engage because if they want to prevent Al-Qaeda from taking a foothold again, they do need to vigorously support us until they either come to a negotiating table with complete honesty and sincerity or they acquiesce and disarm, demobilize and reintegrate into the Afghan society. I'm going to stop right here and allow for any questions and I know time is short so Dr. Simpson I hope I didn't go above what was allocated to me so I'll be happy to answer any questions at this point in time.

Well thank you very much Saki. Uh that was a very interesting and also a bit discouraging. Um because I know you so well and and you are not your normal optimistic self. Um now Saki has a very senior position, a different position now in the Afghanistan government. uh Benoit, who's here on the uh in the gallery, was in Afghanistan as part of the RCMP uh for three weeks and at that time he traveled in an armored personnel carrier and had some security guards. Saki has his own armored personnel carrier and just for the students here, how many security guards do you have now Saki?

Well it's tough to keep count, usually I have about uh 30, 30 uh personal bodyguards with me.

And and he travels in an armored personal car everywhere. Um I don't see any questions but if you do have a question just uh unmute yourself please and then and put up your hand which you do by pressing reactions or just physically like Dr. Dorn has done. Please just put up your hand. So I saw Dr. Dorn first coming in from uh BC from Squamish.

Yeah thanks Erica and thanks for two great presentations. Um I want to focus on the peace process and explore that a little bit with you. Um it's first of all looking at the past, but now we can learn some lessons from the 20 years plus. The um the peace process seemed to be really a secondary thought for most of those 20 years and I think we lost an opportunity—and I would like to be corrected if um if you have different views—that we missed opportunities to be peace-process centric and to do legitimate negotiations when the um when the NATO and government forces were were really strong. So even even in the early 2000s uh we didn't—the attitude was "we don't negotiate with terrorists" and then during the U.S. Obama surge uh it was "well let's uh let's uh first of all win on the battlefield and then we'll talk about peace." So there really were missed opportunities. So first of all comment on the past of peace processes. The present, uh Saki has already said that it's um it's like a holding—they're just um using the peace process to stall while they're arming and and ready to attack. But I do want to explore um the notion that there's still a future for a peace process, I mean maybe after more deadly conflict, um but that there might be also possibility for peace process at a local level. That is, you know, "Talibanism" is not monolithic. That was another big mistake during the 20 years, to view the Taliban as one force; it's actually so many different groups with different supporters. It's not just the question, it's it's so many different aspects. So what about local peace processes? So I guess my question is, you know, for the Canadian Peace Research Association, what's the prospect, what are the lessons about the peace process and what are the prospects for the future?

Can I just say one thing Saki? You can take your time because there are no other questions right now, so—and if you don't mind could you comment a little bit on the role of um Dr. Paolo Cotta-Ramusino please, in terms of behind-the-scenes negotiations and a peace process there?

Right. Um, I'm going to answer uh Dr. Dorn's question first and I'll touch upon that. Um, the peace process at the local level, Dorn, it has to be a community-led, very grassroots type of movement. Now how much effect does a local level peace process with the Taliban lead to a cessation of violence and hostilities with the Afghan National Security Forces? I think those are two questions that there's just not enough time to answer that here. But what I would like to say is that having peace with at the district level is a lot different than having peace with the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Um so the peace process essentially if it has to—if we need to accept peace in exchange for sacrificing the democratic uh achievements we have had over 20 and a half years, for us that's not a peace process, that's acquiescing to the Taliban's demands. We're not going to an ultra-conservative Islamist government again which was only there to support you know which essentially existed as a proxy of other foreign intelligence agencies, which I'm not at liberty to discuss here. But the local peace process Dr. Dorn, I I would just like to touch upon this, you're absolutely right there could be peace at the local level but but that doesn't necessarily mean peace with the legitimate government of Afghanistan. There could be cessation of hostilities but at the same time that does not help with the administration of the government itself.

Um okay. Uh we do have a question from an RCMP officer. Now Saki's thesis also dealt with the police, not just the Afghanistan National Army, and so uh we have a question from Benoit. Did you want to unmute yourself?

Yeah thank you uh. Dr. Nampour, a general question. I had a colleague, an RCMP officer who was the contingent commander in Kabul for one year and he wrote a book about "A Cop in Kabul" and his premise in his book was that the frustration was that sometimes the military had a lot of influence over police training. I just would like to uh listen to your opinion on that or general comments.

Yes, uh thank you for that Benoit. You're absolutely right and in my thesis uh I discussed this extensively on—it's fresh in my mind because I only defended last year. Um the issue as we have known this, and it is very well known in the Security Sector Reform community, is that the para-militarization of the police has been a significant problem. Where community civilian policing has been needed, we have trained our police to fight counter-terrorism, we have trained our police to prevent terrorism, we have trained them to go after insurgents, and nowhere in the world do you see this as an exclusive task of local police forces. So our police are very much lacking in community civilian policing. Uh, it has made it very difficult to build a positive relationship from the very populace they're trying to uh enforce the law upon. And what's happening is that you're seeing a backlash against, you know, police conduct and we see a heightened level of corruption, mistrust, uh questioning the legitimacy of the Ministry of Interior's entire purpose. So we do see this on the daily.

I I just wanted to mention um Saki that Dr. Cotta-Ramusino is in the hospital um again, so he wasn't able to come this morning.

Yes, so I just wanted to mention uh um, well I I call him Paolo, but Dr. Cotta-Ramusino, he's a very, very influential figure here in Afghanistan. He's extremely well-liked in the Afghan circles. Um he's very well-respected here in Afghanistan, believe it or not. He's had a lot of success bringing Taliban leaders right to the negotiating table when the entire international community had given up. So he has—he's an extremely influential figure and uh I've seen this firsthand. He knows the President personally, he knows my boss, my former boss personally. And um back in 2008 when the peace—on this idea of a peace process and reconciliation was coming up, it was actually Paolo who reached out to the Taliban and had these uh secret meetings between himself, the Taliban representatives and Afghan government representatives. So he's had a monumental role in kick-starting the peace process and uh we would like to welcome him someday to Afghanistan, uh like he's come here before and uh it'd be great to uh hear from him in the near future and hopefully if everything goes well we'll see him in November.

Okay well we only have a minute left and so I want to deeply thank uh Saki for coming in from Afghanistan. It's eight o'clock in the evening there and uh we really very much appreciate that you were able to appear on Zoom, Saki. Um and I I I I really appreciate seeing you and I want to just say that uh please stay safe. I know you're not coming back to Canada for a very, very long time and um I just, I'm Frank—I'm his supervisor, I pray for you every day and I hope that you'll be okay.

Well thank you so much! Thank you to all the participants. Erica, thank you for having me and it's been an absolute pleasure talking to each and every one of you and hopefully uh I'll be back sooner or a little later for a visit and uh we'd like to welcome you all to Afghanistan one day once hopefully the security situation improves. We would love to have you all on board. Um thank you so much again and uh God bless you all.

Yeah thank you, thank you. Okay um the networking lounge is open if you want to go there. I'm the chair but I won't be going there because I just have to get the next two sessions going. Um I I encourage you to come to our further sessions and I'm glad to see such a large audience. And I don't think Saki, he's not going to be at the networking lounge but if you want to go there... so how do you get there? Um I'm going to turn to um anyone here who's been a—Yearn, can you just explain to everyone, I guess you go back to the lounge and then... or can you explain to everyone? I haven't had a chance to get there.

Yeah so you go um back to the greeting table and once you're on the greeting table on the left-hand side there's the options under Program/Auditorium, there's a Networking Lounge link. If you click that you'll be able to get into the chat there. Um I think there's also, yeah, there's the Zoom, it says here if you click that link there it'll take you right to the Zoom.

Yeah and there's various breakout rooms so you have to choose the right one. So in the chat it says "please do so in the networking lounge," you're going to the main networking lounge so you would open that link in a new uh tab and then you would go there. Um and then let me just mention we're having another important uh peacekeeping uh and UNIPS and uh the role of the police with Benoit and Dr. Peter Langille, so that will be today as well. So we're going to have a very great day I think in terms of learning more about peacekeeping. Thank you very much and I'm going to say goodbye and take care and thank you.
