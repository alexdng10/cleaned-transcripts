00:02 Hi everyone. Um I'm very uh happy to
00:05 

00:05 introduce to you uh two experts on
00:07 

00:07 deterrence but really we're going to
00:09 

00:09 focus on Guy Roberts today. I want to
00:13 

00:13 introduce him at length and so I will
00:15 

00:15 share a screen and that will help you uh
00:18 

00:18 to understand his background.
00:26 

00:26 Uh guy I I assume you can see the words.
00:30 

00:30 Uh so Guy Roberts is an esteemed
00:32 

00:32 American government official, lawyer,
00:34 

00:34 and retired United States Marine Corps
00:37 

00:37 colonel. He served as the uh US
00:40 

00:40 assistant secretary of defense for
00:43 

00:43 nuclear, chemical, and biological
00:45 

00:45 defense programs from 2017 to 2019. He
00:50 

00:50 was appointed on November the 3rd, 2017
00:54 

00:54 uh during the Trump administration. in
00:55 

00:55 the first Trump admin administration and
00:58 

00:58 Mr. Roberts was the principal advisor to
01:01 

01:01 the secretary of defense. In the United
01:04 

01:04 States, that is the same as Canada's
01:06 

01:06 minister of defense, the deputy
01:08 

01:08 secretary of defense, and the under
01:10 

01:10 secretary of defense for acquisition,
01:13 

01:13 technology, and logistics on matters
01:16 

01:16 concerning nuclear, chemical, and
01:19 

01:19 biological defense programs. In his role
01:22 

01:22 as the assistant secretary of defense
01:24 

01:24 for nuclear, chemical, and biological
01:27 

01:27 um weapons, Mr. Roberts was responsible
01:30 

01:30 for ensuring the safety, security, and
01:33 

01:33 effectiveness of the US nuclear
01:35 

01:35 deterrent. He led efforts to counter
01:37 

01:37 threats from improvised and weapons of
01:40 

01:40 mass destruction, including their
01:42 

01:42 effects and proliferation. His work was
01:45 

01:45 pivotal in maintaining robust defense
01:48 

01:48 mechanisms against such threats and
01:51 

01:51 ensuring the Department of Defense's
01:53 

01:53 compliance with nuclear policies and
01:55 

01:55 regulations. Throughout his tenure in
01:58 

01:58 the Trump administration and at NATO
02:01 

02:01 headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Roberts
02:03 

02:03 emphasized the importance of strategic
02:06 

02:06 deterrence in national defense and
02:09 

02:09 global security. His leadership and
02:12 

02:12 expertise significantly contributed to
02:15 

02:15 strengthening the United States defense
02:17 

02:17 posture, safeguarding the nation, and
02:20 

02:20 addressing the evolving challenges posed
02:22 

02:22 by nuclear, chemical, and biological
02:25 

02:25 threats.
02:27 

02:27 So I'm very happy to welcome uh Guy
02:30 

02:30 Roberts and I'm also going to introduce
02:32 

02:32 to you one of I have one member in the
02:34 

02:34 audience uh Robin Collins who is the
02:37 

02:37 secretary to the Canadian Pugwash group
02:39 

02:39 which is part of the international
02:41 

02:41 conferences of the Pugwash movement.
02:49 

02:49 Okay, thank you guy. Um if you would
02:50 

02:50 like to see
02:54 

02:54 >> I
02:56 

02:56 would like to go ahead and start I
02:58 

02:58 guess.
02:58 

02:58 >> Yes. Yeah. Just go ahead and and we have
03:01 

03:01 about 15 minutes.
03:04 

03:04 >> Okay. Okay. Well, well, thank you very
03:05 

03:05 much for u Erica for that introduction
03:08 

03:08 and um I know we've known each other for
03:11 

03:11 quite a while and shared many many views
03:14 

03:14 and uh most of them diametrically
03:16 

03:16 opposed in some respects. But the the
03:19 

03:19 one thing I always say when I start
03:22 

03:22 talking about these issues is that uh
03:25 

03:25 whether no matter what your position is
03:27 

03:27 on deterrence or uh nuclear disarmament,
03:30 

03:30 we all want the same thing. we would all
03:32 

03:32 like a peaceful, secure,
03:35 

03:35 uh, war-free world. Um, and it's just
03:40 

03:40 that we're coming from a different
03:42 

03:42 polls, I guess you could say. Um, I'm
03:45 

03:45 I'm often uh uh reminded of President
03:50 

03:50 Obama speech he gave uh when he accepted
03:53 

03:53 the No Peace Prize. And what he said
03:56 

03:56 there is uh that we cannot stand idly by
04:00 

04:00 in the face of threats. For make no
04:02 

04:02 mistake, evil does exist in the world
04:06 

04:06 and sometimes force is necessary.
04:09 

04:09 And in 45 years of doing this, I can
04:13 

04:13 absolutely vouch for that. We and we're
04:16 

04:16 even seeing that today. And it really
04:18 

04:18 gets back to how do we confront evil? uh
04:21 

04:21 vice president Chenny Cheney uh said you
04:24 

04:24 know we don't negotiate with evil we
04:27 

04:27 defeat it and u unfortunately we have a
04:31 

04:31 president now who believes that he can
04:34 

04:34 negotiate a a land for a deal
04:38 

04:38 transactional
04:40 

04:40 deal with
04:42 

04:42 an evil empire
04:44 

04:44 um characterized by an evil man in my
04:48 

04:48 view uh Vladimir Putin
04:52 

04:52 Um, and
04:54 

04:54 that's diametrically opposed to history.
04:58 

04:58 Uh, in 45 years of dealing with this
05:01 

05:01 issue, we've seen that in spades. And
05:04 

05:04 all you have to do is look at what's
05:05 

05:05 going on right now in the Ukrainian war
05:08 

05:08 where um uh Putin is the primmaaccia
05:12 

05:12 case of a war criminal committing uh it
05:16 

05:16 seems like every single uh law of war
05:19 

05:19 violation there is. He's managed to to
05:22 

05:22 do it. Uh and we've got human
05:25 

05:25 trafficking, we've got drugs, we've got
05:27 

05:27 you name it. And uh how do you deal with
05:29 

05:29 that? How do you face up to that?
05:31 

05:31 And one of the challenges in the
05:33 

05:33 non-prololiferation world is the fact
05:35 

05:35 that um some 24 25 agreements that would
05:40 

05:40 characterize as non-prololiferation
05:43 

05:43 arms control agreements and every single
05:46 

05:46 one of them Russia has violated. Uh I
05:50 

05:50 would uh commend our students to the
05:53 

05:53 State Department's compliance report on
05:55 

05:55 treaties uh that they publish every year
05:59 

05:59 and uh the the latest one again
06:01 

06:01 documents in great detail all of the
06:04 

06:04 violations that the Russians have made
06:07 

06:07 with regard to their arms control
06:10 

06:10 agreements.
06:12 

06:12 It's um and so now you're faced with how
06:15 

06:15 do you deal with u with a country that
06:19 

06:19 refuses to comply with its international
06:21 

06:21 legal obligations.
06:24 

06:24 The other challenge uh again with the
06:27 

06:27 Russian invasion of Ukraine is the um
06:32 

06:32 assault on sovereignty
06:36 

06:36 by Russia but and broader the assault on
06:41 

06:41 and the destruction of the rules-based
06:44 

06:44 international legal order that we've
06:46 

06:46 lived under for 80 years and has brought
06:49 

06:49 in an unparalleled
06:52 

06:52 history of growth, economic growth,
06:56 

06:56 expansion,
06:58 

06:58 uh, development
06:60 

06:60 that I said is unparalleled.
07:02 

07:02 Uh, and now we have an individual that
07:05 

07:05 seeks to destroy that, to go back to the
07:09 

07:09 great power competition that we've seen
07:12 

07:12 prior to uh, World War II. Uh, and all
07:16 

07:16 of that brings great power competition
07:18 

07:18 has resulted in two world wars. World
07:21 

07:21 War I, some 25 million people died.
07:26 

07:26 In World War II, estimates vary, but 50
07:30 

07:30 million plus died as a result of that
07:33 

07:33 war. And oh, by the way, there were no
07:36 

07:36 nuclear weapons in either one of those
07:37 

07:37 cases. But we haven't seen any great
07:40 

07:40 power war since the end of World War II
07:44 

07:44 that ended with the dropping of two
07:48 

07:48 nuclear weapons.
07:50 

07:50 So there we look at look at that and and
07:54 

07:54 we're faced with u
07:57 

07:57 well these dropping of these bombs raise
07:60 

07:60 uh profound ethical and moral questions
08:02 

08:02 that are hotly debated uh to this day.
08:06 

08:06 Um many of those debates are in thugwash
08:09 

08:09 and other uh forums. Uh but there is the
08:15 

08:15 fact that uh
08:20 

08:20 we have seen
08:23 

08:23 no great power war since World War II.
08:27 

08:27 Um and no nuclear weapons have been used
08:30 

08:30 since August 1945.
08:33 

08:33 Um which would suggest that deterrence
08:37 

08:37 is an effective policy. You know, we can
08:39 

08:39 debate that and and we we do debate
08:42 

08:42 that, but uh you know, the opponents of
08:46 

08:46 nuclear returns argue that, you know, a
08:49 

08:49 strategy of war prevention that relies
08:52 

08:52 on the threat of nuclear annihilation
08:56 

08:56 is incompatible with moral and legal u
09:00 

09:00 uh
09:03 

09:03 principles.
09:05 

09:05 um such as proportionality
09:08 

09:08 and uh the protection of non-combatants
09:11 

09:11 in war. Uh but nevertheless uh although
09:15 

09:15 we may have this sword of domicles
09:17 

09:17 hanging over our head uh there we
09:21 

09:21 haven't had any wars like that and uh in
09:24 

09:24 fact the number of people dying from
09:25 

09:25 wars have dropped precipitously since
09:27 

09:27 the end of World War II. So these these
09:32 

09:32 color everything that we talk about. Uh
09:35 

09:35 and you know in 45 years of dealing with
09:37 

09:37 these issues. Uh
09:40 

09:40 I I I
09:44 

09:44 thought I had never seen uh would never
09:47 

09:47 see uh the wars that we have fought in
09:50 

09:50 Europe today. And uh it's very
09:52 

09:52 disturbing and it's very challenging and
09:55 

09:55 frankly it's it's frightening. And um uh
09:59 

09:59 the only thing that seems to have worked
10:02 

10:02 is to confront evil and to make it clear
10:06 

10:06 that uh in their costbenefit analysis of
10:10 

10:10 whether to go to war or not, it always
10:12 

10:12 comes out against them. So that they
10:16 

10:16 decide when they wake up every morning,
10:17 

10:17 they look around, they say, "Well, not
10:19 

10:19 today. We're not going to fight today
10:22 

10:22 because to do so would be catastrophic
10:24 

10:24 and we would destroy uh and would be we
10:28 

10:28 would be destroyed if we did that. Um
10:32 

10:32 the
10:34 

10:34 but nevertheless it it it's useful that
10:36 

10:36 we have a continued debate and proposals
10:39 

10:39 that come up and I'm going to make one
10:41 

10:41 proposal that I think would would would
10:44 

10:44 in fact uh push the the game further
10:48 

10:48 ahead. Um
10:50 

10:50 first of all the one of the things that
10:53 

10:53 has been touted so to speak is the uh
10:56 

10:56 the nuclear ban treaty. Uh and I did
10:60 

10:60 want to say that you know that that that
11:03 

11:03 is something that uh people were hopeful
11:06 

11:06 of but of course none of the nuclear
11:09 

11:09 weapons states have signed onto the
11:10 

11:10 treaty. So it kind of sits out there. Uh
11:13 

11:13 and
11:15 

11:15 the challenges there are um
11:20 

11:20 multiple and there's no there hasn't
11:24 

11:24 been any really concrete alternatives
11:27 

11:27 that someone could point to to say well
11:29 

11:29 this would substitute for the challenges
11:31 

11:31 of maintaining strategic stability and
11:33 

11:33 security.
11:35 

11:35 Um the first question of course is will
11:38 

11:38 um it improve global security and
11:42 

11:42 the um stability or will it undermine
11:45 

11:45 it? Uh if you have a treaty like that
11:48 

11:48 that takes nuclear weapons out of the
11:50 

11:50 picture, what will replace it? Because
11:53 

11:53 it has proven to be something that um uh
11:59 

11:59 has brought strategic stability uh
12:03 

12:03 although a very dangerous one. I admit
12:05 

12:05 that. Um
12:08 

12:08 the second question is will it build a
12:10 

12:10 coalition for disarmament or fracture
12:13 

12:13 the international community? Uh does it
12:16 

12:16 uh split it up in the sense that uh
12:20 

12:20 there may be uh countries that think
12:22 

12:22 that now that there are no nuclear
12:24 

12:24 weapons that um you know we can pursue
12:26 

12:26 our hegemonic aspirations or uh claims
12:30 

12:30 of territorial u uh more territory or
12:35 

12:35 challenge the very sovereignty of uh a
12:38 

12:38 nation in violation of article 24 of the
12:42 

12:42 UN charter. uh and those are questions
12:44 

12:44 that are left out there u in various
12:48 

12:48 proposals uh
12:50 

12:50 to deal with that uh circulate. Um third
12:55 

12:55 point is will will a nuclear ban treaty
12:58 

12:58 lead to real reductions in nuclear
12:60 

12:60 weapons or would it be a treaty really
13:02 

13:02 for political or non-practical
13:05 

13:05 non-practical effect? Um what does
13:09 

13:09 nuclear abolition really mean? Uh
13:13 

13:13 there
13:15 

13:15 frankly there's no way to walk this dog
13:18 

13:18 back. That is can we have a uh can we
13:23 

13:23 eliminate the knowledge about nuclear
13:25 

13:25 weapons? You can go on the internet and
13:28 

13:28 you can find out how to build a nuclear
13:30 

13:30 weapon. And if you manage to get your
13:32 

13:32 hands on fizzol material uh uranium 235
13:36 

13:36 or plutonium uh then uh all of the
13:40 

13:40 information is is right there. Um and
13:44 

13:44 with enough resources that you can
13:46 

13:46 eventually build yourself an improvised
13:48 

13:48 nuclear device uh that would have
13:51 

13:51 devastating effect. How do you get rid
13:53 

13:53 of that? Um and that leads to a final
13:57 

13:57 question and that is how can such uh
13:59 

13:59 treaty be verified? Um there are
14:03 

14:03 multiple pathways to acquire that. Uh
14:06 

14:06 one example is the AQN network. U AQ
14:10 

14:10 Khan was the father of the Pakistani
14:13 

14:13 nuclear weapon. U he stole a lot of the
14:16 

14:16 design things when he was a student in
14:18 

14:18 California. Um and uh he developed a
14:23 

14:23 broad vast network which he was used
14:24 

14:24 selling nuclear nuclear technology
14:26 

14:26 nuclear information to the highest
14:28 

14:28 bidder. Uh we only found out about it
14:31 

14:31 when we intercepted uh a ship
14:33 

14:33 transporting nuclear materials and
14:35 

14:35 equipment to Libya. Um and to this day
14:39 

14:39 we don't know the extent of that. And
14:41 

14:41 just recently, a member of the Yakuza,
14:45 

14:45 the Japanese uh terrorist/mafia
14:49 

14:49 group u was arrested for uh offering to
14:53 

14:53 sell uh nuclear materials uh to again
14:58 

14:58 the highest bidder. Um and we did not
15:01 

15:01 know anything about that until there was
15:03 

15:03 a u a uh international trafficking uh
15:07 

15:07 interdiction effort made. Um so how do
15:10 

15:10 you how do you deal with that how do you
15:13 

15:13 uh and when you do find and this is
15:16 

15:16 critical
15:17 

15:17 uh finding uh is one thing uh verifying
15:21 

15:21 is another and then enforcing is another
15:25 

15:25 thing. How do you enforce such a treaty
15:27 

15:27 when a uh program is state sponsored
15:32 

15:32 and uh there are many countries that are
15:35 

15:35 virtual nuclear weapons states. Germany
15:37 

15:37 is a nuclear weapon state. Japan is a
15:43 

15:43 could potentially be a nuclear weapon
15:44 

15:44 state. They have the plutonium. They
15:46 

15:46 have the ballistic missile international
15:50 

15:50 international continental ballistic
15:52 

15:52 missile capabilities. They have the
15:54 

15:54 infrastructure. Uh all they lack is the
15:56 

15:56 political will to do so. Um, one of the
16:01 

16:01 again challenges uh that uh Putin has
16:05 

16:05 thrown down at us is uh his claim that
16:09 

16:09 uh they have new nuclear weapons
16:12 

16:12 uh that that aren't governed by any
16:14 

16:14 treaty
16:16 

16:16 and that u they he would potentially use
16:21 

16:21 them against various states that uh
16:25 

16:25 impede his uh aspiration. to build a new
16:29 

16:29 Russian empire. Um I'm sure there are
16:33 

16:33 many people in Ukraine to this day who
16:36 

16:36 ru the day that they gave up their
16:38 

16:38 nuclear weapons. At one point right
16:40 

16:40 after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
16:42 

16:42 Ukraine was one the third largest
16:44 

16:44 nuclear weapons state. They gave up
16:46 

16:46 those nuclear weapons on promises from
16:48 

16:48 Russia, UK and US that uh their
16:52 

16:52 territorial integrity and sovereignty
16:54 

16:54 would remain intact. uh those promises
16:57 

16:57 uh of course uh were very quickly
17:00 

17:00 abandoned by uh by Russia. So that
17:04 

17:04 that's a really big uh challenge. um the
17:08 

17:08 um and and um that which leads me to
17:13 

17:13 what I would like to suggest is one of
17:16 

17:16 the ways forward and one of the things
17:18 

17:18 that students could can get involved in
17:21 

17:21 um is well that
17:25 

17:25 the um one of the challenges is to have
17:28 

17:28 a dialogue between those that believe in
17:31 

17:31 nuclear deterrence and believe its
17:33 

17:33 importance and uh and maintaining
17:37 

17:37 uh peace uh that is uh avoiding conflict
17:42 

17:42 by great powers and those that advocate
17:46 

17:46 uh irrespective of the political
17:48 

17:48 situation if you will disarmament for
17:51 

17:51 disarmament's sake um and um I found
17:54 

17:54 that it's very difficult for those two
17:57 

17:57 particular groups to get together and
17:59 

17:59 have a dialogue and um uh
18:04 

18:04 and it's always been useful for me to uh
18:09 

18:09 talk with u you um Erica um about these
18:14 

18:14 issues and at least understand what
18:17 

18:17 positions you're coming from. Uh I think
18:19 

18:19 that's very very important and I I'm
18:22 

18:22 happy to say that I uh over the last
18:24 

18:24 year or so uh the state department has
18:27 

18:27 uh come up with a program to do just
18:30 

18:30 that. They call it their um
18:33 

18:33 uh creating an uh what are they creating
18:38 

18:38 an environment for nuclear disarmament
18:40 

18:40 initiative. I don't know if you've heard
18:42 

18:42 of that, but uh this is an initiative in
18:46 

18:46 which they want to bring people from all
18:48 

18:48 walks of life and all advocates for and
18:52 

18:52 different things to have a dialogue and
18:53 

18:53 try to build a a stepby-step approach to
18:57 

18:57 where we end up with that happy day
18:60 

18:60 where we no longer need nuclear weapons
19:03 

19:03 to be part of our uh our national
19:05 

19:05 security strategy. Um
19:09 

19:09 and but it's I again because of what
19:12 

19:12 Russia has done and and what we're
19:15 

19:15 seeing um going on with uh a uh peer
19:21 

19:21 competitor China rapidly building their
19:23 

19:23 nuclear weapon uh program. Um that is a
19:28 

19:28 very big challenge. Uh and
19:33 

19:33 so I I would ask uh that uh you take a
19:37 

19:37 look at that State Department program
19:39 

19:39 and uh you could reach out uh to them
19:43 

19:43 about um uh participating in their
19:47 

19:47 efforts to to build uh a uh a program
19:51 

19:51 where we would end up in that. Um just a
19:54 

19:54 real quick word about uh US deterrence
19:56 

19:56 policy. Um, again, there's a lot of
19:59 

19:59 misinformation, disinformation out
20:01 

20:01 there. One of them is that the United
20:03 

20:03 States is part of an arms race. Um,
20:06 

20:06 well, the only thing the United States
20:09 

20:09 is doing is modernizing
20:11 

20:11 with one exception, modernizing their
20:14 

20:14 current nuclear arsenal. They're not
20:16 

20:16 building up to anything more. um not of
20:20 

20:20 course like China who's rapidly building
20:23 

20:23 up to various estimates vary but soon
20:26 

20:26 they will have uh well over 400
20:29 

20:29 um
20:31 

20:31 international ballistic missile sites in
20:33 

20:33 their country and they've got of course
20:35 

20:35 submarines carrying ballistic missiles
20:37 

20:37 and they're developing a bomber to do
20:38 

20:38 the same thing. Um and Russia has
20:41 

20:41 developed a whole cadre of new weapon
20:44 

20:44 systems that again are not under any
20:47 

20:47 treaty whatsoever.
20:49 

20:49 And of course next year when the new
20:52 

20:52 start treaty expires uh I frankly doubt
20:56 

20:56 that it will be renewed. Uh then we will
20:59 

20:59 no longer have any arms control
21:01 

21:01 agreements with Russia.
21:04 

21:04 Uh the other uh thing I hear often is
21:08 

21:08 that uh our nuclear weapons are in hair
21:10 

21:10 trigger alert. Uh nothing could be
21:12 

21:12 further from the truth. Uh they're not
21:15 

21:15 uh and that envisions somebody with
21:17 

21:17 their finger one inch from a a button
21:19 

21:19 that'll launch World War II. U we're a
21:23 

21:23 long way from that. There's a a number
21:25 

21:25 of um
21:28 

21:28 of measures that have to be taken to
21:31 

21:31 to get to the point where we'd actually
21:33 

21:33 launch nuclear weapon. Um and uh there's
21:38 

21:38 uh and the readiness of those weapons
21:41 

21:41 are based on the uh security level
21:44 

21:44 that's determined over through a number
21:47 

21:47 of different u categories.
21:50 

21:50 Uh there's no policy of automatic
21:53 

21:53 retaliation if it uh that's come up
21:55 

21:55 several times that you know once we see
21:57 

21:57 launches that we would immediately
21:58 

21:58 launch. Uh there is a deliberative
22:00 

22:00 process that's built into the uh
22:03 

22:03 warnings and indications uh uh and
22:05 

22:05 communication systems that we manage our
22:08 

22:08 nuclear deterrent. Um and there
22:13 

22:13 are absolutely
22:15 

22:15 no plans uh that are being made for a
22:19 

22:19 preemptive use of uh nuclear weapons. U
22:22 

22:22 they are uh the use of those weapons
22:25 

22:25 would be based on a deliberative process
22:29 

22:29 uh usually in consultation with our
22:31 

22:31 allies before such weapons would be uh
22:34 

22:34 would be used. Um
22:37 

22:37 so the aim of our US deterrent policy is
22:40 

22:40 to prevent any use of nuclear force. Uh
22:43 

22:43 and the whole goal of deterrence is uh
22:47 

22:47 to ensure that nuclear weapons are never
22:49 

22:49 used in a military way. But I've as I've
22:53 

22:53 often said we actually use nuclear
22:55 

22:55 weapons every single day uh because they
22:58 

22:58 are a political weapon. uh they are
23:02 

23:02 there to uh ensure that uh adversaries
23:06 

23:06 when they do their costbenefit analysis
23:08 

23:08 always come to the conclusion that the
23:10 

23:10 costs far outweigh the benefits. Um well
23:14 

23:14 let me let me stop there. I again I I
23:18 

23:18 think we're we're facing a a real
23:21 

23:21 challenge to the international
23:23 

23:23 rules-based international legal order.
23:26 

23:26 Uh that's far more uh goes far beyond a
23:30 

23:30 mere land grab by Russia and taking
23:32 

23:32 territory from Ukraine. has thrown the
23:35 

23:35 gauntlet down uh uh challenging
23:39 

23:39 uh the rules that we've set forth in the
23:42 

23:42 UN charter over uh territorial integrity
23:46 

23:46 and the right to sovereignty. Uh now uh
23:49 

23:49 we're facing a new era where the great
23:52 

23:52 powers would dictate to the small and
23:54 

23:54 middle powers uh what they should and
23:57 

23:57 shouldn't do and what kind of territory
23:59 

23:59 they're going to have. and we've seen in
24:01 

24:01 the past what kind of a uh result that
24:06 

24:06 would occur as a result of that. So uh I
24:10 

24:10 I I can't stress enough in my view the
24:13 

24:13 importance of standing firm and tall and
24:17 

24:17 enforcing the system that we have now uh
24:20 

24:20 in the face of uh of this ex existential
24:22 

24:22 threat. So let me stop there and uh
24:28 

24:28 >> happy to have any questions.
24:30 

24:30 >> Thank you. Thank you guy. That was an
24:32 

24:32 excellent that was a very succinct and
24:35 

24:35 cogent summary of many arguments in
24:38 

24:38 favor of the nuclear uh deterrent
24:40 

24:40 strategy and policy of the United
24:42 

24:42 States. So I I thank you for preparing
24:43 

24:43 that. I I um I've heard your arguments
24:47 

24:47 before and every time I'm I'm very much
24:50 

24:50 persuaded and then I recall my arguments
24:52 

24:52 against you because you know what we we
24:55 

24:55 argue about or we talk about. I'm I'm
24:57 

24:57 glad you raised the idea of a dialogue.
24:59 

24:59 Um and in view of that I invited Robin
25:02 

25:02 Collins to ask a question just a single
25:05 

25:05 question Robin. Um or and then maybe a
25:08 

25:08 followup. So Robin go ahead.
25:12 

25:12 >> Uh thanks very much guys.
25:14 

25:14 listening to it, I was taking a million
25:16 

25:16 notes. Um,
25:19 

25:19 uh, I actually have more than two
25:21 

25:21 questions, but let let me just I I I
25:24 

25:24 would like to get a discussion about,
25:26 

25:26 uh, no first use in at some point, but
25:27 

25:27 let let me let me go to the the key
25:29 

25:29 questions I wanted to ask. Um, I think
25:32 

25:32 your argument is that nuclear deterrence
25:34 

25:34 is safer than no nuclear deterrence. I
25:37 

25:37 think that's a an underlying argument
25:39 

25:39 that you're making. So a key question
25:42 

25:42 for me is
25:45 

25:45 um in your view is nuclear deterrence
25:48 

25:48 permanent
25:49 

25:49 and therefore what conditions would have
25:52 

25:52 to exist for nuclear deterrence to be
25:55 

25:55 disposed of?
25:59 

25:59 >> Okay, thank you for that. uh I don't
26:02 

26:02 think it deterrence nuclear deterrence
26:05 

26:05 is uh permanent uh for
26:10 

26:10 what I see is going on in
26:14 

26:14 uh the development of technologies
26:17 

26:17 there are uh things happening that I uh
26:22 

26:22 very surprised about uh drone warfare
26:26 

26:26 that we are seeing going on right now uh
26:28 

26:28 and the technological advances
26:31 

26:31 of um which bring moral and legal
26:34 

26:34 challenges. Um you may know that for
26:37 

26:37 example there's a movement now to ban
26:39 

26:39 robots on the battlefield. Um there was
26:42 

26:42 conference held every year in Geneva 30
26:45 

26:45 40 nations attend. Um we are very close
26:48 

26:48 to u terminator type of technologies. Uh
26:53 

26:53 there was a robotics conference just I
26:55 

26:55 think last month. unbelievable how
26:59 

26:59 well-developed these robot systems are.
27:02 

27:02 Um, and it raises some very interesting
27:06 

27:06 uh, as I said, moral and legal issues
27:08 

27:08 about uh, uh, authorizing uh, uh, robots
27:14 

27:14 to engage in combat
27:18 

27:18 uh, and uh, what are the rules regarding
27:22 

27:22 that? what whose responsibility is it to
27:25 

27:25 ensure that uh non-combatants are kept
27:28 

27:28 as safe as possible in environments like
27:31 

27:31 that? Those technologies um uh
27:35 

27:35 especially the precision technologies
27:38 

27:38 have gotten to the point where fewer and
27:40 

27:40 we see fewer and fewer you uh instances
27:44 

27:44 where nuclear weapons would be a a
27:47 

27:47 method of choice.
27:49 

27:49 um we haven't reached that point where
27:52 

27:52 you can say well we don't need nuclear
27:53 

27:53 weapons as the ultimate um
27:58 

27:58 because I think there still is um
28:01 

28:01 a feeling that um you can overcome those
28:06 

28:06 uh the guy that invented Fritz Habber I
28:10 

28:10 think his name is uh in invented u gas
28:14 

28:14 warfare in World War I uh and when asked
28:18 

28:18 why he did this. Uh he and he came up I
28:22 

28:22 think he invented fosgene and u a few of
28:26 

28:26 the others mustard gas and sarin he said
28:28 

28:28 well these weapons are so horrible that
28:30 

28:30 once people see them uh they they won't
28:33 

28:33 they won't engage in warfare well he was
28:36 

28:36 wrong uh they simply
28:39 

28:39 the allied side did develop their own
28:42 

28:42 chaos warfare and went ahead with it
28:45 

28:45 fast forward to the use of the In terms
28:49 

28:49 >> I'm sorry. Go ahead.
28:50 

28:50 >> Well, I'm just wondering in terms of
28:51 

28:51 technological development, do you think
28:53 

28:53 that the United States, China, and
28:54 

28:54 Russia will go into space? Trump has
28:56 

28:56 been talking about a US space force. I
28:58 

28:58 mean, I understand your argument about
29:00 

29:00 drones, and now they're developing nets
29:02 

29:02 against drones, but don't you think it
29:04 

29:04 makes sense to go into space? Wouldn't
29:06 

29:06 that be the next frontier?
29:09 

29:09 >> Yes. I mean, of course, they've got the
29:11 

29:11 golden dome program, uh, the United
29:13 

29:13 States is developing and, uh, which is
29:16 

29:16 really kind of an evolution of the
29:18 

29:18 brilliant pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe
29:19 

29:19 pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pebbles
29:19 

29:19 initiative that they had when the
29:22 

29:22 strategic defense initiative and the
29:23 

29:23 reagan administration. Um, and yeah, I
29:26 

29:26 think that that's going forward as well.
29:28 

29:28 And um, there's
29:31 

29:31 a number of technologies that could be
29:34 

29:34 used. Uh uh some suspect that the
29:37 

29:37 Chinese have already developed
29:39 

29:39 satellites that could be flown into
29:41 

29:41 other satellites that could you know
29:43 

29:43 create havoc
29:46 

29:46 >> balloons. I mean the the ubiquitous
29:49 

29:49 explosion of technologies in different
29:52 

29:52 directions that weren't predicted
29:56 

29:56 uh means it's hard hard to really uh get
29:60 

29:60 your hands around all of this stuff, you
30:02 

30:02 know. Um and I I I think you know the uh
30:06 

30:06 consequences of using nuclear weapons uh
30:09 

30:09 the uh incidental effects uh the
30:12 

30:12 collateral damage
30:14 

30:14 it makes people hesitate.
30:16 

30:16 >> Yeah. The nuclear taboo teaches them
30:18 

30:18 about the nuclear taboo. The idea that
30:22 

30:22 no see this is the other in history
30:24 

30:24 >> right and this is the other problem is
30:26 

30:26 that you know again that Putin has laid
30:29 

30:29 the lie to the US or the nuclear weapons
30:33 

30:33 states positive and negative security
30:36 

30:36 assurances
30:38 

30:38 as you know we we promised that we would
30:40 

30:40 never use or threaten to use nuclear
30:43 

30:43 weapons against non-nuclear weapons
30:45 

30:45 states and gave those assurances and
30:47 

30:47 we'd do it again in 2016 at the next
30:49 

30:49 review conference
30:51 

30:51 >> 2026
30:52 

30:52 >> but nobody is going to believe it
30:54 

30:54 because Russia uh has threatened to use
30:59 

30:59 nuclear weapons against non-uclear
31:01 

31:01 weapon states and what's the consequence
31:04 

31:04 of that which leads to the next question
31:06 

31:06 of course is uh countries like Turkey
31:10 

31:10 Saudi Arabia even Germany and Japan have
31:13 

31:13 had started to have a dialogue South
31:15 

31:15 Korea a dialogue about well we need to
31:18 

31:18 have nuclear weapons because those
31:19 

31:19 security assurances that were given to
31:21 

31:21 us don't mean anything.
31:24 

31:24 >> This is a good segue into the question
31:25 

31:25 about no first use. I think uh
31:28 

31:28 >> yeah, I
31:29 

31:29 >> if um
31:31 

31:31 uh if it if it's the case that uh the
31:34 

31:34 United States and other nuclear weapons
31:36 

31:36 states would never use nuclear weapons
31:38 

31:38 against a conventional threat, then they
31:41 

31:41 should be able to support together, not
31:43 

31:43 unilaterally, no first use policy.
31:47 

31:47 Um, but I don't think that's actually
31:49 

31:49 the policy. I think the policy is to use
31:52 

31:52 the threat of nuclear uh warfare against
31:55 

31:55 a conventional threat as well as against
31:58 

31:58 a nuclear threat to deter both. Am I not
32:01 

32:01 am I not correct?
32:03 

32:03 Yes, I I think you are correct because
32:06 

32:06 uh in my job at NATO um
32:10 

32:10 it was quite clear that uh I was there
32:13 

32:13 from uh 2005 to 2011. Uh but I was also
32:19 

32:19 in uh the defense department uh dealing
32:24 

32:24 with NATO from 2000 on.
32:27 

32:27 And um the when the
32:32 

32:32 seven new states joined NATO in 2003
32:35 

32:35 which include the Baltic states, every
32:37 

32:37 single one of those countries said that
32:39 

32:39 the primary reason they joined is to
32:42 

32:42 come under the nuclear umbrella of NATO.
32:44 

32:44 Mhm.
32:45 

32:45 >> And and that was incredibly important
32:48 

32:48 for them
32:50 

32:50 and that uh they are the one some of the
32:53 

32:53 countries that have very forcibly come
32:55 

32:55 out against no uh the no first use idea
32:58 

32:58 because they want that threat to be real
33:01 

33:01 and palpable to well Russia primarily
33:05 

33:05 that uh if they invaded these countries
33:08 

33:08 that in order to stop them the threat or
33:12 

33:12 actual use of uh nuclear weapons would
33:15 

33:15 be in play and they believe very
33:18 

33:18 strongly that that threat is what keeps
33:21 

33:21 the Russians on their side of the
33:23 

33:23 border. Um and likewise
33:27 

33:27 that I've had several conversations. In
33:30 

33:30 fact, last November, I was in Turkey for
33:33 

33:33 a conference uh gave a speech there and
33:37 

33:37 uh several uh people afterwards came up
33:40 

33:40 and talked about well, you know, if we
33:43 

33:43 can't be under a nuclear umbrella, then
33:46 

33:46 we're going to develop our own. In fact,
33:48 

33:48 u Erdogon has actually said that that uh
33:51 

33:51 there's no reason why we shouldn't have
33:53 

33:53 nuclear weapons. and and and that that's
33:56 

33:56 one of the real challenges the
33:57 

33:57 non-prololiferation aspect the very
33:59 

33:59 important part of that of uh keeping
34:02 

34:02 countries from say thinking that their
34:06 

34:06 strategic
34:08 

34:08 safety and security means they need to
34:10 

34:10 require that weapon capability as well.
34:14 

34:14 >> Thank you guy. I I recall when we met
34:16 

34:16 back in 2006 and you were I I believe
34:20 

34:20 chairing the nuclear planning group on
34:22 

34:22 behalf of the United States which is the
34:24 

34:24 official uh group that meets I believe
34:26 

34:26 every week to talk about nuclear issues.
34:28 

34:28 So you were highly experienced back then
34:30 

34:30 in 2006 and then went on um to be really
34:34 

34:34 at the apex of power just below the
34:36 

34:36 secretary of defense but also all in
34:38 

34:38 charge of not just nuclear modernization
34:41 

34:41 but biological and chemical weapons as
34:43 

34:43 well. So this has been a very rich and
34:46 

34:46 thank you very much. Uh I really
34:47 

34:47 appreciate this discussion. I want to
34:49 

34:49 emphasize to everyone that's listening
34:51 

34:51 that uh guy also attended the nuclear
34:54 

34:54 non-prololiferation review conferences
34:56 

34:56 and I saw him there in 2010 2015. So you
34:59 

34:59 have made a an excellent effort to reach
35:02 

35:02 out and to have a dialogue with people
35:05 

35:05 who are involved in nuclear arms control
35:08 

35:08 and disarmment. So I want to thank you
35:09 

35:09 for that contribution. Well, I was
35:11 

35:11 actually um I was actually the 1995
35:14 

35:14 extension conference as well that was uh
35:16 

35:16 uh we had a very proactive group that
35:20 

35:20 went out and convinced nations that it
35:22 

35:22 was in everybody's interest to
35:24 

35:24 indefinitely extend the NPT. So I over
35:28 

35:28 15 years.
35:29 

35:29 >> Did you know uh well I'll stop there.
35:31 

35:31 I'll stop recording if you don't mind.
35:33 

35:33 But thank you very much on behalf of
35:35 

35:35 everyone and I really appreciate this.
35:37 

35:37 Thank you.
