Welcome to lesson 2B on nuclear weapons and nuclear proliferation. We will be going through a lot of new terms for you
0:08
and some of this may be too quick. Those of you that have taken my other courses will be familiar with many of these
0:13
concepts. First of all, we're going to talk about
0:18
a multipolar world, many powers, and the problem of nuclear weapon proliferation.
0:24
So because of the end of the cold war, many people think that actually a nuclear exchange is more likely today
0:30
than it was back in the bipolar world during the cold war. And that's because of the chance of accidental nuclear war,
0:37
misperception, miscommunication, misunderstanding, and also the doctrine of nuclear deterrence and preemptive
0:44
nuclear warfare. Preemptive nuclear warfare.
0:49
Given that there were many past nuclear accidents, you can read about failures of communication in 1984 and so on. The
0:56
chance of a nuclear exchange is higher as more and more countries obtain nuclear weapons. Can you survive a
1:03
nuclear war? Certainly not. And it is useless to try to read those sort of nuclear war survival skills, building a
1:10
bunker in your backyard and so on. Uh perhaps I put a map here. um the chance
1:16
many Europeans are worried about a war in Europe. Uh so here's the Baltic
1:22
countries and Kenanrad which belongs to Russia that has deployed nuclear weapons. Now,
1:30
the problem is the divide between the nuclear weapon states that have nuclear weapons that brandish nuclear weapons
1:36
that wave them around as if they're credible and usable without realizing the humanitarian consequences for
1:43
humans, for human security worldwide because of a nuclear accident or a nuclear war. So they are opposed to the
1:51
non-nuclear weapon states, the NNWS, and they are increasingly frustrated
1:57
with the nuclear weapon states because of their relatively slow pace of nuclear disarmament since 1945.
2:08
Five state parties, members of the nuclear non-prololiferation treaty, are not part of the NPT. It's a pretty
2:15
successful treaty when you think about it. It was established back in 1986 and experts predicted that 25 to 30
2:23
nuclear weapon states would happen within 20 years and that's what did not happen. This means that they did predict
2:30
what they called a nuclear jungle with no overarching power like the UN would
2:36
happen by around 1988 and that didn't happen. There is no nuclear jungle with
2:41
no rules right now because arguably because of the NPT the the the uh
2:47
nuclear non-prololiferation treaty review conferences and the regime and
2:53
the nuclear taboo which I'll talk about in a few minutes and because of the international approprium about the use
2:59
of nuclear weapons. So I put here a picture of Douglas Rosh uh who was a
3:04
speaker just recently at my most recent class and he argued that there would be
3:10
a nuclear jungle. He's been very strong about the MPT over the years a retired
3:15
uh established the middle power initiative. And I put here a picture of another diplomat who I invited to the
3:21
class here. She's the minister. She was the ambassador to uh Iran, but I think she's probably not going to be able to
3:27
speak because once you are retired, you still have for a few years, you're not allowed to talk about diplomacy.
3:34
I'm still negotiating with her. State parties are not part of the NPT
3:40
and there's five. So the five state parties are India, Israel, Pakistan, and
3:46
South Sudan, which doesn't have nuclear weapons for sure. And then the DPRK, North Korea, the the Democratic People's
3:54
Republic of Korea, the DPRK exceeded meant they they signed the NPT back in
3:59
1985, but they never came into compliance with the safeguards and
4:05
announced their withdrawal, its withdrawal.
4:11
The other problems, and we're going to go through a lot of them now, are the spread of nuclear weapons into space because of the ballistic missile defense
4:18
program. The Golden Dome. I'll be talking about that. The spread of nuclear weapons under Arctic ice and
4:24
into oceans, off the coasts, hidden. The NPT has a review conference about every
4:31
5 years. The next one will be in 2026 because of COVID. It's delayed. Uh these
4:36
are international and national conferences and it all leads up every 5 years to the MPT review conference. I'm
4:42
attending a meeting and I'm hosting meetings and so on to get ready for the MPT review conference to in
4:49
consultations with the nuclear arms control and uh disarmament division of the global affairs Canada on January
4:55
30th. We're all concerned about nuclear weapons spreading into space into oceans
5:01
and also under the ice.
5:06
Experts are concerned particularly about the implications of the US ballistic missile defense project which President
5:12
Trump has called the Golden Dome. This is a project that's been around for a long time and has great implications for
5:19
Russia's sense of insecurity and China's nuclear defense posture and implications
5:25
for space debris out in space.
5:30
I'll talk about a lot of these issues but this is just our sort of 2B and we're trying to get some of the
5:36
vocabulary about talking about Canada round two. So Canada, Prime Minister Carney has been asked by President Trump
5:43
to participate in the Golden Dome and they are holding high level discussions about that right now whether Canada will
5:50
join that project which has implications not for just Canada and the Arctic but also for Iran, Ireland,
5:58
Iran, Ireland too actually it's a middle power Greenland and Denmark Greenland is
6:03
part of Denmark. the nuclear weapons operating under the
6:10
ice. We'll talk about that when we talk about Arctic sovereignty, but they're also a big problem. Although they're
6:15
contributing to the strategic triad and to stability, they can hover unseen,
6:21
virtually undetectable for weeks at a time under the Arctic ice, Russians,
6:27
Americans, and Chinese or off the coasts, let's say, of the United States.
6:35
I have been active for 25 years with the Canadian Pugwash Group. There's a picture of me looking uh well 10 years
6:41
ago when I was at the NPT. Adele Buckley has died this summer uh very sadly. And
6:47
she was uh spearheading at the age of 88, a nuclear weapon free zone in the
6:52
Arctic. And I worked with her and Romeo Delair, the general who opposed the
6:57
genocide uh in Rwanda. And I've worked for a long time with Alan Wear who just got the alternate Nobel laurate, which
7:05
is a prize of 50,000 for an alternate piece. U President Trump is not asking
7:10
for that one. Anyway, I've worked with various people on denuclearizing. And if you're interested in helping, we sure
7:16
need people. There's only a few of us left. In fact, really only very few.
7:23
We have some money. We have about $10,000 to do a campaign. But I mean, here I am writing an article with Romeo
7:30
Delair. And see the picture they put of the snake with the tip of the snake, which is an ICBM over the Arctic. I
7:36
thought it was a cool picture to show you.
7:41
Okay, so the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, now called Russia, emerged as victors. They
7:48
were victorious from World War II. And the NPT enshrines their right to openly
7:55
possess nuclear weapons. They possessed nuclear weapons at the time that the NPT was signed back in 1968. So the treaty
8:04
acknowledges their nuclear status, but it is not a formal approval for them
8:09
holding nuclear weapons. So they're called the big three. So the great powers, the big three, the United
8:16
States, um Russia, and China. They those are the the big three. The big five are
8:23
also the United Kingdom, which includes Scotland, Wales, and England, and and
8:28
also France, a unitary state. Those five have veto power in the United Nations
8:34
General Assembly, which you just saw me pictured at 15 years ago. No, 10 years ago.
8:40
At the most successful, that was the most successful. That's why I was looking so happy. We just succeeded in
8:46
getting 64 planks of the MP of the for the MPT review conference. But all that has gone by the wayside now. Diplomacy
8:53
is so desparing. I put a woman here shaking her head
8:59
because so many students of mine have written when I used to teach in person essays on reforming the UN Security
9:06
Council, reforming the UN General Assembly. I think I've read hundreds of essays on that and all of those people I
9:12
don't know where they are, teachers, diplomats now, but it is nothing has happened. Uh so the assumption then was
9:18
having nuclear weapons equates to veto power. But that would mean that if other non-uclear weapons states like let's say
9:25
in alphabetical order always so as not to give priority Germany, Japan, Nigeria and South Africa could wield the veto
9:32
power eventually unlikely. But if you are interested um I did do a a reading
9:37
course on the United Nations Security Council reform uh two years ago for jazz deep sidu and there's a supplementary
9:44
lecture on how to be an excellent student that you can listen to uh with jazz on that if you want and other
9:51
students obviously. Okay. So, North Korea has continually
9:58
fired rockets, not yet with nuclear weapons on them and since 2016 and it
10:03
has said that it it has a hydrogen bomb. It conducted it in 2016. Uh I showed you
10:10
a picture of Kim Jong-un. He is Russia's close ally now and is sending prisoners
10:15
to fight against Ukraine. I was in uh South Korea here in the demilitarized
10:20
zone and saw all these tunnels and um was in Seoul. So here there's the
10:25
partition line. There's the line between North and South Korea. So I looked this way into North Korea.
10:36
Okay. So that we we mentioned that the uh North Korea is not part of the MPT and we mentioned that there are
10:42
negotiations through the MPT review conference but the whole process is really deadlocked because of the
10:47
existence of the arsenal of the P5. The P5, the permanent five, the five that I talked about, the three and the two. The
10:54
United States and Russia have the most nuclear weapons, but bilateral arms negotiations concerning their relatively
11:01
larger arsenals are going too slowly according to the nuclear non-uclear weapons states. And that's very true.
11:06
President Trump just recently said that they will not renew the start in February, next month, because the
11:13
negotiations are just not working and he he thinks he can start the negotiations again.
11:19
So here you see all these old men negotiating.
11:26
Okay. Diplomats still argue. We argue vehemently about this. People that are involved in this like Ambassador Peggy
11:33
Mason who I tried to get to speak to our UN class. I'm still working on that. Um Ernie Regger uh who just got the um
11:41
peace prize uh Canadian peace prize. Um they argue I listened to them in October
11:47
argue for one full hour about a certain article and about whether it was diplomatic to criticize other countries
11:53
or not. One full hour in front of a big audience. We were all kind of wondering like wow if they're arguing these two
12:00
are on the same side then imagine how much the Russians and the North Koreans would be arguing.
12:06
Anyway, we talk a lot about article six and good faith and so on, but I talk a lot about
12:13
NATO's strategic concept. So, I'm considered to be an expert on NATO. I've written many, many articles on NATO.
12:19
Just type in Erica Simpson NATO. Um, I've written a book on NATO and the bomb, but anyway, NATO strategic concept
12:26
non-binding. It's a document they issue over and over again, and the basic language of it is
12:32
always the same. There's Guy Roberts. Guy Roberts, the person who I
12:38
interviewed here for a class. There he is much younger, probably 20 years ago. And Jamie Sheay, who I interviewed, the
12:45
longest serving uh diplomat at the UN or not at the UN, at NATO. I've interviewed him three times. He just retired. I I
12:52
interviewed him on his last day, on his last afternoon, which was a great interview. They always say the same
12:58
thing. the supreme guarantee of the allies that the French and the UK nuclear weapons are contri contribution
13:04
to their overall deterrence and security. So now I'm bringing up this word don't be afraid of deterrence. So
13:11
NATO strategic concept says as long as nuclear weapons exist NATO will remain a nuclear alliance which basically means
13:17
forever.
13:24
Okay. So there's mounting nuclear arsenals and modernization. And now I'm going to start talking about modernization and negative and positive
13:30
security assurances. So I'm not going to get too much into this. Uh negative insuranceances
13:36
mean that you can threaten a country that's not part of the NPT. So for example, you could threaten the uh DPRK.
13:44
Right now Putin and uh Trump are threatening everyone. And I'll talk about that in lesson C uh C. But
13:52
positive security assurances reassure a country that has signed the MPG that it h or any other guarantee that it is
14:00
committed to defending. So that's what Ukraine would wants. It wants a positive security assurance to say that they will
14:06
be defended in case of an attack. Here we're talking about it in the context of
14:12
a nuclear attack. So that's why Japan does not need yet to come out and say they're going to develop their own
14:18
nuclear weapons. There uh we are there is Paul Meyer whom I'm meeting with next week who's the former ambassador to the
14:24
conference on disarmament. Kim Campbell the prime minister former prime minister of Canada the only female uh Doug Ro and
14:32
oh and then Jonathan Granoff the president of the Global Security Institute whom I interviewed for my
14:38
other class. So some of you will have heard a lot about nuclear weapons if you're taking all three of my classes. But that's good because that's
14:45
important. So is climate change.
14:50
Okay, I mentioned to you Paul Meyer. Paul Meyer mourns this terribly. He was a diplomat for years at the conference
14:56
and he always brings up in his speeches if you heard him in my other class that they're deadlocked and they have not
15:02
done anything for decades. He gets quite uptight about it. That's because the NPT
15:08
has many loopholes, ways to get around it despite the additional protocols and
15:13
so on. merely the fact that it almost condones Iran's pursuit of nuclear energy. Iran has tons of oil. Why does
15:21
Iran need nuclear energy? It has tons and tons of oil. But anyway, the NPT is
15:27
not really able to cope with North Korea, Syria possibly having nuclear weapons in the long run, Saudi Arabia,
15:34
and other mounting arsenals outside the NPT framework. It's a older treaty and it's it's not it's it's difficult.
15:45
Now Canada actually helped to establish the the uh
15:50
global partnership program and we're very proud of that and we've spent billions on it. I'm going to Ottawa at
15:56
the end of the month for the nuclear arms control disarmment discussions. I'm invited as an expert and believe me I
16:02
know they will be talking with a whole PowerPoint program for 1 hour about the global partnership program and how they
16:08
have contributed to it. The Russia has canceled its participation. It doesn't want um its sovereignty undermined and
16:16
poorly paid Russian soldiers and so on continue to be a problem because they could uh sell nuclear material on the on
16:22
the black market. Okay. So the global partnership program
16:30
deals with trained physicists trying to pay them and skilled nuclear workers in Russia and soldiers and that's a
16:36
long-term concern and the United States and Canada together have spent literally billions and billions of dollars on
16:42
that. It's very important program. According to uh Senator Richard Luger,
16:48
more such partners are needed worldwide concerning other nuclear powers but there are none.
16:56
Okay. So a tactical nuclear war would cause nuclear winter and famine. I mentioned this before and now I want to go through these slides which show you
17:03
global warming due to um the industrial revolution
17:08
uh and so on. And then um that's global cooling because of a uh regional nuclear
17:15
war using approximately 100 nuclear weapons. Now if they were to use more
17:20
nuclear weapons then there would be um a global warming of minus4 degrees around
17:26
the world uh let's say because of um using their high alert nuclear weapons
17:32
and then this was what we envision could happen during the cold war where they used all of their nuclear weapons the
17:37
global nuclear arsenal and then you would also have a nuclear winter.
17:43
So that's uh global warming since 1880. And you can see that a nuclear winter
17:48
would would cool down the whole earth uh considerably.
17:55
Here's the view of um the Apollo 10 view of the Earth in 1969 from 26,000
18:01
nautical miles and you can see Mexico there.
18:07
And that's what the world would look like after a large scale nuclear holocaust. And you can see the clouds of
18:12
smoke and resulting fires would essentially cover the entire northern hemisphere and also all the way down to
18:18
New Zealand within two weeks. So the problem is let's say there was a
18:25
a war a local regional war between not uh just for example between India and
18:30
Pakistan they each have approximately 150 nuclear weapons approximately. India is going to obtain more nuclear weapons
18:36
soon but I'll talk about that in a minute. Um so here what we see is let's
18:42
say they used 100 Hiroshima size nuclear weapons or 0.05%
18:47
of all the USRussian deployed weapons approximately used somewhere around the world 0.05%.
18:55
Then there would be millions of tons of smoke rising into the stratosphere and global temperatures would drop to what
19:01
they were 10,000 years ago to little ice age levels.
19:09
25 to 40% of the ozone around the world would be destroyed at the mid latitudes and 50 to 70% would be destroyed at
19:16
northern high latitudes.
19:23
Okay. So here you can see let's say there was a nuclear war with just a 100 herim size nuclear weapons. This is how
19:31
the earth would cool over a period of 2 weeks. So you can see the temperature is
19:36
dropping all around the world. I'm covering New Zealand. Uh but eventually New Zealand will also freeze and um all
19:43
the there would be world as I mentioned worldwide famine. The entire global economy would completely collapse. Uh
19:50
billions of people would die of starvation within um a few weeks if not
19:56
for certain a few months. And uh there you are. So, we'll just let that run for
20:02
a m a few minutes to absorb the impact and the recognition that where my red
20:07
laser dot is is where I am right now. And you can see the temperature is just continually dropping into a nuclear
20:14
winter, even if it's summer. Okay,
20:19
moving on. So, there's the change in average surface temperatures 2 years after an
20:25
IndiaPakistan nuclear war. And you can see up the temperature has dropped by around 1.5° in uh uh Toronto and then
20:35
it's also dropped all around the world here. You can't quite see Australia and New Zealand. Uh it's dropped around
20:43
particularly in the northern hemisphere. That doesn't mean you should try to move to New Zealand. You can't escape it.
20:50
Here's the changes in global precipitation. So you can see that um it's it's a drought. Um there's there's
20:57
not much there's anyway it's just extremely concerning.
21:05
Okay. What about would there be a nuclear winter from the use of loose nukes and
21:10
dirty bombs? No. The they they think that the damage would be about it depends where if it was in New York City
21:17
it would obviously damage and kill millions of people. uh but a dirty bomb
21:23
let's say smuggled from Canada in kitty litter across into the New York City or
21:29
Washington the main issue there is people would flee to 27 cities all
21:35
around the United they would flee out of the cities into the country for days at a time they wouldn't come back into their cities so this is called nuclear
21:42
terrorism and Graham Allison who's a famous writer um about the Cuban missile
21:47
crisis has written a lot about that but a dirty bomb is not as big concern as tactical or strategic or hydrogen
21:55
nuclear weapons. Okay. So this leads me to talk about the
22:02
problem of nuclear waste which will remain dangerous for literally hundreds of thousands of years. It it reduces the
22:09
radiation reduces over thousands of years. But until we figure out a what to do with the nuclear waste, the highlevel
22:16
rods and the low-level and intermediate level nuclear waste, then we have a
22:21
problem. Nuclear terrorists could perhaps capture the the the trucks and so on that are carrying nuclear waste.
22:28
And nuclear waste right now has is stored above ground. There's no working underground depository anywhere in the
22:35
world. Finland's working on one and Canada has some proposals. I'll talk to you about that. But here's the Bruce
22:41
Power nuclear reactor which is on the shore of Lake Hiron up north of God in
22:47
King Garden. And these could be soft targets for their nuclear uh and so they
22:54
are surrounded I've visited it. Uh it's surrounded with barb wire and security guards and protected by the uh the IAEA,
23:00
the International Atomic Energy Agency. But I'm well known for arguing that it's
23:08
a it's a threat, a terrorist threat and Canada's proposed
23:13
there's some proposals. Um this I could talk for an hour on this one single slide, but essentially there's been a
23:19
few proposals and the current proposals are to build a nuclear waste site uh 46
23:25
km away from the Bruce reactor uh and then another one up in Revel Ignis. And
23:33
so the one is called Ravel Ignis and the other one is called Teasewater. Um now
23:38
down here this is a I mentioned there's no real depository. This is an artist's rendition of one that they could have
23:45
built in Yaka Mountain in Texas, but that was rejected by President Obama and
23:51
then um President Trump started that process again and he's considering it
23:57
and so on. They need to do something with their waste. they may look up north to Canada and say, "Oh, we should use Canada."
24:06
Okay? So, I'm a critic of the two sites and so I'm very aware of the fact I don't want to bias you against it. So,
24:12
for example, this picture could be seen as biasing you because there's like here on how far away is the site um and so
24:18
on. Is it limestone and so on. So, um these are some questions that are being
24:24
asked. So, where is it? It's right there on the shore of the Great Lakes, the largest freshwater reserve in the world.
24:30
And there you can see 30 km. So it would be um around here close to King Cardan,
24:36
the one 46 km away from Douglas Point from the the many reactors here. This is
24:43
the largest operating nuclear reactor in the world. There's there's different
24:48
reactors in here. Uh so that right now they're they're burring the waste here above ground at the western waste
24:54
management facility but the proposal is to take all of Canada's waste the low
24:59
and intermediate level and put it here.
25:05
Now, of course, the people in Ignis in Revel Ignis are are opposed. Many people
25:10
are opposed to having the nuclear waste from Pickering and Darlington and from Quebec and from New Brunswick all
25:17
trucked up to their tiny uh area, particularly First Nations are opposed.
25:23
So, we the Nuclear-free North, there's information. They have the best website on trying to figure out this issue. I
25:30
highly recommend this this one run by Brennan Lloyd if you want to
25:36
if you want to learn. So this is the only map I could find and of course it was on their website. Uh so there's all
25:42
the proposed transportation of the nuclear waste there would be I think it
25:48
was I can't quite remember but the estimate is that there would be for 30 years
25:54
50 trucks. I don't want to say it because but it and I don't want to say what their estimate is because it's so
26:00
incredibly concerning about accidents and so on. And this road is a you've driven I've driven this road. This is
26:07
essentially a two-lane highway and it in the winter it is very difficult.
26:12
It's also crossing many First Nations. So if you want to get involved, take a look at that site. The decision
26:21
the decision will be made uh in the next few years mainly this year and that
26:26
leads me to talk about dismantled nuclear weapons and waste. So the NPT
26:31
allows countries to develop nuclear energy. Iran has the right to develop its own nuclear energy. Um so at the
26:38
same time we're kind of preserving the NPT and saying you can have your own nuclear energy. Something has to be done
26:44
with the nuclear waste from dismantled nuclear bombs and from nuclear power plants that have to be decommissioned
26:51
over time. They have to be
26:56
the fact that the United States at the same time is modernizing its nuclear weapons. This is the whole nuclear
27:01
modernization debate that Guy Roberts actually um spearheaded. Um and that's
27:08
the idea. And it's interesting because in this in Yuiard he refers to it all. Um in the first one he he talks about it
27:13
and the necessity of it and so on. But now um despite the cost of modernization
27:19
being in the tens of billions that's not his main concern. The threat is is coming from other other countries.
27:29
Okay. So what is the debate? The debate about the B-61 bomber here is whether it
27:34
should whether these five uh five countries in NATO uh in Europe should
27:40
continue to host the United States um nuclear weapons. And Russia points to
27:46
that and says, "Well, we're going to put nuclear weapons in clean and ground because you have these tactical nuclear weapons in Germany, the United States,
27:53
the United Kingdom, and Turkey." I talked to the mayor, not of Italy, but
28:00
of Turkey once. I sat beside him um at a conference and he was just so appalled
28:07
that it that his own village was what he called a soft sight, a soft target, that his own village would be wiped out
28:14
because it had and it was hosting these secret nuclear weapons.
28:21
I could get into this more, but Russia is revitalizing its Arctic bases. It's moving into the Arctic and it's refusing
28:28
to negotiate about its advantage in tactical nuclear weapons. It has more tactical nuclear weapons than the United
28:34
States. Russia is deploying nuclear weapons in the Arctic and it's dumping
28:39
its waste, its nuclear waste into rivers and frozen rivers in the Arctic.
28:44
Meanwhile, the United State Department is maintaining that Russia is not willing to negotiate tactical nuclear
28:50
weapons. And that's true. The Russians are saying that at the heart of this is the BMD issue and that that is the

30:01
I just wrote one with Dr. Gordon Edwards, the president of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility

and that was in the globe and mail which you don't have a subscription to neither do I but you can get it through the
30:25
university through press reader uh so that was there and I just wanted to put that as a final kind of slide to tell
30:33
you just how important I feel that this
