00:01 Okay, welcome to our last lecture uh
00:03 

00:03 before the guest speaker on nuclear
00:05 

00:05 weapons and the nuke map. Here's a
00:07 

00:07 picture of Hiroshima on the uh in the in
00:11 

00:11 1945. I was there uh uh recently and it
00:16 

00:16 has regrown. The trees are back and so
00:18 

00:18 on, but there are many memorials and
00:20 

00:20 there is a a museum which is well worth
00:23 

00:23 seeing.
00:24 

00:24 Here's
00:26 

00:26 a picture of a from a credible
00:28 

00:28 authority, the Federation of American
00:30 

00:30 Scientists. Matt Corda is uh actually
00:33 

00:33 now located in Toronto working online
00:35 

00:35 and they use satellites. They use uh
00:38 

00:38 online and free accessible information
00:41 

00:41 to try to figure out the uh global
00:44 

00:44 nuclear warhead inventories around the
00:46 

00:46 world. So, they're considered to be
00:48 

00:48 incredibly credible. This is 2023
00:51 

00:51 and they're saying that um Israel has
00:54 

00:54 approximately nuclear approximately 90
00:57 

00:57 nuclear weapons. They don't know for
00:58 

00:58 certain, but that's what they're
00:60 

00:60 confirming. Uh China back then a year
01:03 

01:03 ago had 410.
01:08 

01:08 Here is some estimates from another
01:10 

01:10 American think tank called the Arms
01:13 

01:13 Control Association. Also very credible.
01:16 

01:16 its founder Daryl Kimell uh raises money
01:20 

01:20 and they do their own estimates. So here
01:22 

01:22 you can see that in 2025
01:25 

01:25 uh they're estimating that China has
01:27 

01:27 close to 600 nuclear weapons. A large
01:31 

01:31 jump which concerns uh many people
01:33 

01:33 around the world.
01:37 

01:37 The other uh things that we refer to are
01:39 

01:39 the bomb. The bomb is popular jargon. I
01:41 

01:41 wrote a book NATO and the bomb. A
01:44 

01:44 Hiroshima day is another popular term
01:47 

01:47 for commemorating Hiroshima and
01:50 

01:50 Nagasaki.
01:52 

01:52 The nuke map, we're referring to nuclear
01:54 

01:54 weapons or the missile map. These are
01:57 

01:57 popular websites that show you the
01:59 

01:59 impact of different types of bombs on
02:02 

02:02 cities like your own. Let's look for
02:04 

02:04 example.
02:06 

02:06 Here's a I put in um London, Ontario. if
02:11 

02:11 it was hit by the first Hiroshima boy
02:15 

02:15 first Hiroshima bomb the small tactical
02:18 

02:18 weapon called little boy and it would
02:21 

02:21 kill um approximately 263,000
02:24 

02:24 people uh and there would be 512,000
02:29 

02:29 uh so this is a very very small tactical
02:31 

02:31 nuclear weapon
02:35 

02:35 uh here I put in London again and now
02:38 

02:38 hitting it with a Russian bomb, which is
02:42 

02:42 a megat ton bomb. And the fatalities are
02:45 

02:45 going all the way up uh to northern
02:48 

02:48 Ontario. Um with the estimated
02:51 

02:51 fatalities here of 435,000 estimated and
02:55 

02:55 many many more injuries would be
02:57 

02:57 impossible to cope with that many
02:59 

02:59 injuries.
03:02 

03:02 Here I put in um Sudbury close to uh
03:08 

03:08 Ignis Revel where the uh nuclear waste
03:11 

03:11 high level intermediate site would be.
03:13 

03:13 So let's say that in a preemptive attack
03:16 

03:16 Russia was to attack that with a very
03:19 

03:19 very crude nuclear weapon very very
03:21 

03:21 crude some terrorists or something. The
03:23 

03:23 fatalities are low because there's not
03:25 

03:25 that many people up in that area um and
03:28 

03:28 the injuries are low. Uh but that's just
03:31 

03:31 from a small let's say dirty bomb.
03:36 

03:36 Here um more seriously is a North Korean
03:39 

03:39 weapon tested in 2017. So they at that
03:43 

03:43 time said they couldn't reach the west
03:46 

03:46 coast of the United States. They boast
03:48 

03:48 that they can now reach with their um
03:51 

03:51 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
03:53 

03:53 They can reach that far. And that's one
03:55 

03:55 of the reasons that people are talking
03:58 

03:58 about ballistic missile defense and a
04:00 

04:00 project in space to shoot down a single
04:03 

04:03 weapon like this. So the um I put here
04:07 

04:07 the effect on on Vancouver and you can
04:10 

04:10 see it's stretching all the way into
04:11 

04:11 North Vancouver, Richmond, Sururi, uh
04:14 

04:14 Burnaby and so on and the number of
04:17 

04:17 estimated casualties uh as well as
04:19 

04:19 injuries is is very very high impossible
04:23 

04:23 to to cope with at that point. Um
04:28 

04:28 so in 2025 we commemorated the 80th
04:31 

04:31 anniversary of the use of atomic weapons
04:33 

04:33 over Japan. In 1945 a small 14 kiloton
04:38 

04:38 uranium bomb carrying uranium not
04:40 

04:40 plutonium exploded at Hiroshima on
04:43 

04:43 August 6th 1945. And then a plutonium
04:47 

04:47 bomb was dropped on August 9th 3 days
04:50 

04:50 later on Nagasaki. it killed between the
04:54 

04:54 estimates are 129,000 and 226,000
04:58 

04:58 people in total. So um we don't know the
05:01 

05:01 numbers that were killed in Hiroshima
05:03 

05:03 and Nagasaki accurately but around
05:06 

05:06 around that many people.
05:11 

05:11 Here's the picture of uh the second last
05:15 

05:15 uh survivor who lived in Canada
05:17 

05:17 protected by his mother. Uh so he was
05:20 

05:20 very young baby and he was killed by a
05:23 

05:23 drunk driver in Ottawa actually a few
05:24 

05:24 years ago. He was very active Hibigucha.
05:27 

05:27 These are the people who are the
05:29 

05:29 survivors of Hiroshima Nagasaki. They're
05:32 

05:32 called the Hibigusha. Um, debates
05:34 

05:34 continue to this day about whether the
05:37 

05:37 bombings would have
05:39 

05:39 whether they stopped the um whether not
05:42 

05:42 bombing Hiroshima Nagasaki would have
05:44 

05:44 led to the surrender eventually of Japan
05:47 

05:47 or not of the emperor. There's no doubt
05:50 

05:50 that tens of thousands of Japanese
05:52 

05:52 civilians and this is the use of nuclear
05:54 

05:54 weapons against civilians were
05:56 

05:56 intentionally targeted from just two
05:59 

05:59 small uh detonations.
06:02 

06:02 The International Court of Justice in
06:05 

06:05 legal international legal opinion
06:06 

06:06 determined there exists an obligation to
06:09 

06:09 pursue in good faith and bring to a
06:11 

06:11 conclusion negotiations leading to
06:13 

06:13 nuclear disarmament. So here's a picture
06:15 

06:15 of the bulletin um the the atomic clock.
06:19 

06:19 It's still standing and it's also a
06:21 

06:21 memorial. You can go there and visit
06:23 

06:23 there. Very moving. Um this is the river
06:27 

06:27 where hundreds of people fled down to
06:29 

06:29 the river burning up. Um,
06:33 

06:33 and it's it's a very moving place to go.
06:37 

06:37 I am a board member of many different
06:40 

06:40 organizations to do with nuclear
06:42 

06:42 weapons, to do with abolishing nuclear
06:44 

06:44 weapons, to say no to nuclear war. Um,
06:46 

06:46 kind of what I've worked on for for 30
06:49 

06:49 years now. And so I'm part of the
06:51 

06:51 Canadian um network to abolish nuclear
06:54 

06:54 weapons on the board. And I'm also the
06:57 

06:57 president of the Canadian Peace Research
06:58 

06:58 Association. and I've been a member
07:01 

07:01 board member for a very long time of the
07:03 

07:03 Canadian Pugwash group. So I put the
07:05 

07:05 links in there. You'd have to go to the
07:07 

07:07 PowerPoint to link them. Uh if you are
07:09 

07:09 interested in joining those
07:10 

07:10 organizations, students are always very
07:12 

07:12 very welcome.
07:14 

07:14 And that leads me to talk about the
07:15 

07:15 number of nuclear weapons that are
07:17 

07:17 remaining which is around 13,000
07:20 

07:20 12,500 or you could argue 13,000 more
07:24 

07:24 than 90% belonging to the Russia and the
07:26 

07:26 United States. And that's that's the
07:28 

07:28 serious thing here is that this is a
07:30 

07:30 problem between the two superpowers and
07:33 

07:33 their their um their bombs some of them
07:37 

07:37 which are in the megat ton range their
07:39 

07:39 hydrogen bombs are thousands of times
07:43 

07:43 more lethal than the tactical nuclear
07:45 

07:45 weapons.
07:47 

07:47 Across the world, commemorative events
07:49 

07:49 are held every year to remind us of the
07:51 

07:51 terrible cost and the ongoing danger of
07:53 

07:53 nuclear arms race, the modernization,
07:56 

07:56 the impact of a limited nuclear missile
07:59 

07:59 exchange. Yet, the nine official and
08:01 

08:01 unofficial nuclear arms states are
08:03 

08:03 intent on rebuilding, modernizing, and
08:06 

08:06 uh retaining actually their nuclear
08:08 

08:08 warheads.
08:10 

08:10 President Vladimir Putin's frequent
08:12 

08:12 references to possible use of nuclear
08:14 

08:14 weapons seems to be leading to apathy.
08:16 

08:16 People don't seem to be able to do
08:18 

08:18 anything cuz they're terrified or
08:20 

08:20 they're just staying very quiet. I'm not
08:22 

08:22 sure. Are they fearful? We don't know a
08:26 

08:26 lot about nuclear weapons because they
08:27 

08:27 are a legacy of the last century during
08:29 

08:29 the Cold War.
08:32 

08:32 This year, the hands of the Bulletin of
08:34 

08:34 Atomic Scientists doomsday clock now as
08:37 

08:37 of February point to 89 seconds to
08:40 

08:40 midnight as of last February. I don't
08:42 

08:42 know what they will be this coming uh
08:44 

08:44 February, but essentially they're moving
08:47 

08:47 them closer and closer to midnight.
08:49 

08:49 Midnight is global annihilation,
08:51 

08:51 extinction of all human species, the
08:54 

08:54 planet, a rock in space, uh with nothing
08:57 

08:57 on it. So, we have to obviously think
08:59 

08:59 about that and collectively take action.
09:02 

09:02 How you do that is is up to you. But I
09:06 

09:06 think arguing for no first use in the
09:08 

09:08 United States is very popular. arguing
09:10 

09:10 that there should be no preemptive use
09:12 

09:12 of nuclear weapons. First, the United
09:13 

09:13 States and Russia do not have no first
09:16 

09:16 use. China does. Uh we could also
09:20 

09:20 follow in the steps of the United States
09:22 

09:22 and argue for dealerting nuclear
09:24 

09:24 warheads. Some organizations are doing
09:26 

09:26 that, but there are American
09:28 

09:28 organizations ending launch on warning
09:30 

09:30 policies and so on. These are not
09:33 

09:33 substitutes for bringing about the kind
09:35 

09:35 of world that would be stable that would
09:38 

09:38 not need nuclear weapons because the the
09:40 

09:40 genie is out of the bottle. Nuclear
09:41 

09:41 nuclear knowledge is here to stay. So we
09:44 

09:44 need deeper structural ways to to to
09:47 

09:47 solve conflict and to and to work toward
09:50 

09:50 peace on Earth.
09:52 

09:52 Here in Canada, the government is not
09:54 

09:54 engaged in discussions about the TPNW
09:58 

09:58 about sending observers. I'll be in
09:60 

09:60 Ottawa soon and we'll be making the same
10:02 

10:02 arguments that we always do that we need
10:04 

10:04 to send observers to the PN TBNW that we
10:07 

10:07 need to strengthen our stand at the MPT
10:10 

10:10 that we need to propose an NWC a nuclear
10:12 

10:12 weapons convention that the BWC
10:15 

10:15 biological weapons convention and uh um
10:18 

10:18 biological and toxic weapons convention
10:20 

10:20 and the chemical weapons convention are
10:22 

10:22 examples of what we can do. So these are
10:25 

10:25 a lot of acronyms, a lot of words and
10:26 

10:26 that is how everyone talks. So I need to
10:30 

10:30 train you. I'm trying to train you to
10:31 

10:31 talk about things all sorts of things
10:33 

10:33 like trade and so on. I'm working toward
10:35 

10:35 that. This class is very focused on NATO
10:38 

10:38 and on uh President Trump's new ideas
10:41 

10:41 like a golden dome in space. We talk a
10:44 

10:44 lot about nuclear arms control
10:45 

10:45 disarmament in this in this lesson. And
10:48 

10:48 obviously I think there should be more
10:50 

10:50 parliamentary debate. We'll talk more
10:51 

10:51 about how you can write a parliamentary
10:54 

10:54 resolution and what you can do to
10:56 

10:56 advance your goals and what you think
10:58 

10:58 are important. Obviously, I think a
10:60 

10:60 nuclear abolition is important. The
11:02 

11:02 janitor has started to wash the floor
11:04 

11:04 outside my office even though I have
11:06 

11:06 signs up.
11:09 

11:09 No, she's going to wash the floor. Okay,
11:10 

11:10 there's that's fine. I love her. Rosa,
11:13 

11:13 let's go talk to Rosa. No, I can't stop.
11:17 

11:17 Professor Simpson has argued and I can't
11:19 

11:19 stop because I've argued for 30 years
11:20 

11:20 that we need to undertake a leadership
11:22 

11:22 role within NATO toward creating the
11:25 

11:25 world creating the conditions for a
11:27 

11:27 world free of nuclear weapons and Canada
11:30 

11:30 should spearhead a comprehensive
11:32 

11:32 re-examination of NATO's reliance on
11:35 

11:35 nuclear deterrence. So this is what I
11:38 

11:38 work on as a professor. I think there
11:40 

11:40 needs to be a rejection of deterrence.
11:42 

11:42 And that's why it's such an honor for me
11:44 

11:44 to have Guy Roberts speak to my class.
11:46 

11:46 He and I have been arguing about this at
11:48 

11:48 NATO headquarters for since 2006. We're
11:51 

11:51 good friends. Even though we disagree,
11:53 

11:53 we're very, very good friends.
11:56 

11:56 Abolition, I agree, will never happen in
11:58 

11:58 a strategic vacuum. I'm the first to say
12:00 

12:00 that it will take generations and
12:02 

12:02 generations to build a durable security
12:05 

12:05 framework based upon the principles of
12:07 

12:07 common security and sustainable peace in
12:11 

12:11 order to prevent future nuclear
12:12 

12:12 breakouts and arms races, including in
12:15 

12:15 space.
12:21 

12:21 Europeans are encouraging their
12:23 

12:23 governments to take lead roles as part
12:25 

12:25 of the Stockholm initiative. This is a
12:27 

12:27 multilateral forum that was established
12:30 

12:30 in 2019. It's not really going anywhere.
12:33 

12:33 It's working to um try to strengthen the
12:35 

12:35 NPT. There's a picture of the UN General
12:37 

12:37 Assembly. We'll talk more about the UN.
12:41 

12:41 And then finally, the Japanese who
12:44 

12:44 survived um Satsuka Thurlo. They believe
12:48 

12:48 that another future is possible. In the
12:51 

12:51 words of the um betress fine
12:55 

12:55 um when they got the Nobel Peace Prize
12:58 

12:58 uh ours is the only reality is possible.
13:01 

13:01 The alternative is unthinkable. So you
13:03 

13:03 know we we have no choice. We have to
13:04 

13:04 work toward a world that is free of
13:07 

13:07 nuclear weapons.
13:10 

13:10 Many people would like a Nobel Peace
13:11 

13:11 Prize including uh President Trump.
13:14 

13:14 Here's a letter that I received
13:15 

13:15 yesterday from Satsuko Thurlo, the only
13:17 

13:17 surviving Hibikusha in her late8s. Um,
13:22 

13:22 and she's asking me for my advice about
13:25 

13:25 some American who wants her to nominate
13:28 

13:28 be one of the nominees nominators of a
13:31 

13:31 guy, Mr. Meer Meyer, and she hasn't
13:34 

13:34 heard of him. My so she's asking me if
13:36 

13:36 I've heard of his good work. And then I
13:38 

13:38 wrote her yesterday, you know, you don't
13:40 

13:40 need to reply or engage. you have to you
13:44 

13:44 have known the person. So, she wrote
13:45 

13:45 that letter back. So, I'm just pointing
13:47 

13:47 out to you that people are trying to get
13:50 

13:50 Nobel Peace Prizes for all sorts of
13:52 

13:52 things. Uh, but what about ending war?
13:56 

13:56 And that leads me to end my part on
13:59 

13:59 whether nuclear weapons could be used in
14:01 

14:01 this century, not the last century, but
14:02 

14:02 now.
14:04 

14:04 And that leads me to talk about Mr.
14:06 

14:06 Trump because he has now said on January
14:08 

14:08 10th, 2026, I don't need international
14:12 

14:12 law. Uh he he says powers constrained by
14:16 

14:16 my own morality. Now, he has on record
14:19 

14:19 said that he wants nuclear weapons to be
14:22 

14:22 more usable. And then he's also said
14:23 

14:23 he's afraid of nuclear war. Everything
14:26 

14:26 is a little bit contradictory. We're not
14:28 

14:28 sure what he thinks, right? But he knows
14:31 

14:31 that morality, the only thing that can
14:33 

14:33 stop him is his own morality.
14:36 

14:36 So this uh New York Times uh interview
14:38 

14:38 has gone all around the world. Um it was
14:41 

14:41 published on January 20 or January 7th
14:44 

14:44 and he said there's one thing my own
14:46 

14:46 morality my own mind the only thing that
14:48 

14:48 can stop me. Kind of um strange uh in
14:52 

14:52 terms of the limits on his international
14:54 

14:54 power.
14:57 

14:57 I don't need international law. I'm not
14:59 

14:59 looking to hurt people. he's saying. So,
15:02 

15:02 this follows uh the United States
15:04 

15:04 attacks on seven countries in 2025. I
15:07 

15:07 looked for a map and the only map I
15:09 

15:09 could find was from Algera News uh
15:12 

15:12 picturing all the attacks in 2025.
15:20 

15:20 Here's the US attack in Venezuela
15:24 

15:24 just recently.
15:28 

15:28 Here's another attack on Yemen,
15:31 

15:31 on the Houthis and Yemen
15:35 

15:35 destruction.
15:36 

15:36 Um, another attack on Syria. Here's
15:38 

15:38 Peter Hexus, the the uh
15:44 

15:44 war, minister of war. I always call him
15:47 

15:47 Minister of War.
15:52 

15:52 Here's the US strikes in Somalia.
15:55 

15:55 Here's
15:57 

15:57 the US strikes in Nigeria. So, I haven't
15:59 

15:59 put grizzly pictures of the effect. Um,
16:02 

16:02 but if you are from Nigeria and you're
16:04 

16:04 in this class, why not come and talk to
16:06 

16:06 me and maybe we can do a Zoom if you
16:09 

16:09 have experience or if you've seen
16:10 

16:10 anything like this.
16:13 

16:13 If you're a student from Iraq or from
16:15 

16:15 Iran, why don't you contact me by email
16:18 

16:18 and maybe we can have some sort of a
16:20 

16:20 supplementary discussion. This is um
16:23 

16:23 where the United States eliminated a an
16:28 

16:28 a ISIS leader. Uh but then also they've
16:32 

16:32 been attacked. Americans have been
16:33 

16:33 attacked um by all over the place uh as
16:38 

16:38 well. So it's not like a oneway thing.
16:42 

16:42 Um this is the US attacks on nuclear
16:45 

16:45 sites in Iran which I brought up in our
16:47 

16:47 first part in in in 2A.
16:51 

16:51 So they've attacked the nuclear
16:53 

16:53 facilities.
16:57 

16:57 We will discuss when we cover NATO in
16:59 

16:59 lesson 8 after the spring break that
17:02 

17:02 President Trump is also threatening to
17:04 

17:04 take Greenland the hard way. I'm not
17:06 

17:06 sure what the hard way means, but it is
17:09 

17:09 imperialism when you're saying that you
17:11 

17:11 can dominate other countries whether
17:13 

17:13 they like it or not. That goes against
17:15 

17:15 UN international law, the UN General
17:17 

17:17 Assembly and so on. And he's spoken
17:20 

17:20 again about taking over Greenland on
17:22 

17:22 January 9th. I don't know by lesson 8
17:25 

17:25 what will have happened.
17:28 

17:28 By lesson 10, which will be for the
17:30 

17:30 final exam, we will be talking about
17:32 

17:32 Arctic sovereignty. And I want to
17:34 

17:34 conclude uh our series here by
17:37 

17:37 mentioning that for that class I
17:39 

17:39 interviewed Arctic explorers who had
17:42 

17:42 actually kayaked across Baffan Island
17:45 

17:45 and gone toward Greenland. So they speak
17:48 

17:48 at length before all these threats um
17:51 

17:51 about what this area is like Arctic
17:54 

17:54 sovereignty and and the effect of
17:56 

17:56 climate change. Uh they were on a wooden
17:58 

17:58 sailboat in Vancouver when I interviewed
18:00 

18:00 them. This is a very popular video. Uh
18:04 

18:04 there's some minor concerns. Um
18:08 

18:08 basically they both were drinking wine.
18:10 

18:10 It was late for them and they uh
18:13 

18:13 encountered a nuclear submarine off
18:15 

18:15 Victoria and so on. So it's an exciting
18:17 

18:17 interview. I don't want to necessarily
18:19 

18:19 delete it, but things will change by
18:22 

18:22 lesson 10.4 before and we may be talking
18:24 

18:24 about some kind of a annexation of
18:27 

18:27 Greenland
18:29 

18:29 in which case I'm I I'm thinking about
18:31 

18:31 interviewing a professor Rob Huber who
18:34 

18:34 in the media is always put there to
18:37 

18:37 oppose me just like Guy Roberts and he's
18:40 

18:40 willing to come to the class and talk
18:42 

18:42 for 20 minutes. Okay, thanks for
18:44 

18:44 listening.
