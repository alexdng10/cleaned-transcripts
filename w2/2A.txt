00:01 students to lesson 2 A which I've
00:03 

00:03 entitled Nuclear Nightmares. We will be
00:06 

00:06 talking a lot this week about nuclear
00:08 

00:08 weapons, nuclear proliferation, nuke
00:10 

00:10 maps, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the
00:13 

00:13 possibility of a nuclear war. Today,
00:19 

00:19 I want to remind you that I do not use
00:21 

00:21 Proctor Track. So, please do not write
00:23 

00:23 me asking if I use Proctor Track. nor
00:26 

00:26 will I be checking I will not be
00:28 

00:28 checking how much time you spend online
00:31 

00:31 simply because Albrightace does not
00:33 

00:33 record properly the time that is spent
00:36 

00:36 online. It is not recorded and I will
00:39 

00:39 not pay attention to whether you access
00:42 

00:42 the lessons and for how long unless of
00:44 

00:44 course you get 100% on the exams and
00:47 

00:47 then I do a cross check. The class is
00:49 

00:49 full. Please do not write to me as
00:51 

00:51 students are at this very moment as
00:54 

00:54 today is the last day. You cannot uh
00:56 

00:56 skip the queue for any reason. The class
00:59 

00:59 was filled a long time ago and I do not
01:01 

01:01 control access. I will not write
01:04 

01:04 reference letters for anyone in this
01:06 

01:06 class due to the nature of an online
01:08 

01:08 class. I cannot study your CV and
01:10 

01:10 transcript. Otherwise, I would have to
01:12 

01:12 write reference letters for everyone in
01:14 

01:14 the class. And that would be doing you
01:16 

01:16 what's called a disservice. You need a
01:18 

01:18 reference letter from a fourthyear
01:20 

01:20 professor who knows you, who have heard
01:22 

01:22 you, perhaps a thirdyear professor. I
01:25 

01:25 would not be doing you a service by
01:26 

01:26 writing you any kind of a reference
01:28 

01:28 letter for medical school, law school or
01:30 

01:30 anything like that. We do not know
01:32 

01:32 whether we will have a TA. There are
01:34 

01:34 thousand 1,800 students in the class. I
01:38 

01:38 do not know whether I will have a TA and
01:40 

01:40 their tasks are not clear. I mentioned
01:42 

01:42 that because I have programmed the exam
01:44 

01:44 and the quiz dates on the course
01:46 

01:46 calendar. They are not in the course
01:48 

01:48 syllabus. Please do not write me asking
01:51 

01:51 me to confirm whether you understand
01:53 

01:53 whether the quiz and the exam rates are
01:55 

01:55 correct. You can use the chatbot. Please
01:57 

01:57 do not write me again as students are
01:59 

01:59 doing asking me again when the dates
02:02 

02:02 are. You are responsible. You're grown
02:05 

02:05 up. New lectures are posted for sure by
02:08 

02:08 Thursday each week depending on the
02:09 

02:09 guest lectures. Sometimes the guest
02:12 

02:12 lectures cancel on me many times. And
02:14 

02:14 for example, today I'm early because I
02:16 

02:16 did the guest lecture in October.
02:19 

02:19 Recording and setting up lectures takes
02:21 

02:21 a lot of time. Please be patient and
02:23 

02:23 please do not write me every day on
02:25 

02:25 Monday uh asking me when I'm going to
02:27 

02:27 post the hour the the stuff because your
02:30 

02:30 schedule demands that you keep up. I'm
02:33 

02:33 trying to keep up too. And so let's just
02:35 

02:35 all work together and and try to stay
02:37 

02:37 positive.
02:40 

02:40 uh pre President Putin has delivered as
02:42 

02:42 of uh January 11th a warning shot using
02:45 

02:45 a nuclear capable missile and that sent
02:48 

02:48 a message to Europe and to Canada and
02:51 

02:51 the NATO countries days after they
02:53 

02:53 agreed to a post-war security guarantee
02:56 

02:56 and so it's not certain what is going to
02:59 

02:59 happen right now is particularly
03:01 

03:01 interesting because Russia equipped the
03:03 

03:03 missile with dummy warheads they didn't
03:06 

03:06 equipped it with nuclear warheads and so
03:08 

03:08 without those nuclear warheads. It
03:09 

03:09 appears like this Orretchnik missile is
03:13 

03:13 technically underwhelming, but it is
03:14 

03:14 sending a message.
03:18 

03:18 The message is a warning message. It is
03:20 

03:20 they are saying that they are using
03:22 

03:22 willing to use an expensive system. They
03:24 

03:24 can only produce a small number of those
03:26 

03:26 missiles each year. And to use it on
03:29 

03:29 Keev in an attack confirms that they are
03:32 

03:32 trying to say that they want to
03:34 

03:34 intimidate Europe and also North
03:37 

03:37 America.
03:40 

03:40 Here's some pictures of the Orishnik U
03:43 

03:43 missile. And you can see my my picture
03:45 

03:45 is hiding um some of the details of this
03:47 

03:47 intermediate range ballistic missile
03:49 

03:49 that can go very quickly. Um it has the
03:53 

03:53 capability of multiple up to six nuclear
03:56 

03:56 warheads. Mr. Putin therefore is trying
04:00 

04:00 to manipulate a sense of nuclear risk
04:03 

04:03 arguably and we're going to talk a lot
04:04 

04:04 about that in this lecture. We're going
04:06 

04:06 to start talking about the effects of
04:09 

04:09 threats.
04:12 

04:12 Many of us who lived, I didn't myself
04:14 

04:14 live through the Cuban missile crisis,
04:16 

04:16 but many older experts um say that our
04:19 

04:19 present- day crisis is actually riskier,
04:21 

04:21 far more riskier in a multipolar world
04:24 

04:24 with many powers having nuclear weapons
04:26 

04:26 than it was back in the bilateral uh war
04:30 

04:30 world, the bilateral world of two
04:32 

04:32 superpowers, the Russia and the United
04:34 

04:34 States. So, we need to think just like
04:37 

04:37 the XCOM pictured here, the executive
04:39 

04:39 committee during the Cuban missile
04:40 

04:40 crisis that advised President Kennedy.
04:43 

04:43 We need to think of how to extricate
04:45 

04:45 ourselves from this mess that we're in,
04:47 

04:47 which could lead to war due to
04:49 

04:49 miscalculation, misperception, and
04:51 

04:51 misunderstanding,
04:54 

04:54 the three misses. So, war is folly, and
04:57 

04:57 assuredly here's President uh Silinski
04:60 

04:60 and also President Putin. And I'm sure
05:02 

05:02 that President Putin is possibly uh
05:06 

05:06 rethinking his initial decision to
05:08 

05:08 attack Kev in order to topple Vladimir
05:11 

05:11 Zilinsk's government. He has not been
05:13 

05:13 able to do so in nearly 5 years to he
05:16 

05:16 has not been able to liberate the
05:18 

05:18 Donbass region by sheer force and by
05:21 

05:21 persuasion and they held some referenda
05:24 

05:24 in Donets Gluhans Keren and Zaparitzia
05:27 

05:27 but where the nuclear power plant is but
05:29 

05:29 that will not obscure the reality that
05:31 

05:31 Russia's hold over the war torn region
05:34 

05:34 will be tenuous for decades to come
05:36 

05:36 because there are so many people who
05:38 

05:38 hate Russia who who who are of Ukrainian
05:42 

05:42 um citizenship and and descent.
05:46 

05:46 So, here's a picture of the disputed
05:48 

05:48 areas and the possibility of a new a
05:51 

05:51 central force in Europe uh going along
05:54 

05:54 here or here. We're not sure. Now,
05:56 

05:56 Russia's already taken here and I'll
05:58 

05:58 talk to you about that in the next
05:59 

05:59 slide. So, there's Ukraine, Russia, and
06:02 

06:02 the and the neighboring uh neutral or
06:04 

06:04 not neutral country, but Malddova is not
06:06 

06:06 part of NATO. Romania and Poland are
06:11 

06:11 I'll talk more about NATO in the weeks
06:13 

06:13 to come and especially in lesson 8, but
06:15 

06:15 right now we will just be focusing for a
06:17 

06:17 few moments on the Crimean Peninsula,
06:19 

06:19 the Crimean Peninsula, the Crimean
06:22 

06:22 Peninsula. It was annexed by Russia in
06:24 

06:24 2014 and that is now under constant
06:27 

06:27 threat. Indeed, the Russian submarines
06:30 

06:30 are not able to harbor there safely and
06:32 

06:32 they're being redeployed up to the
06:34 

06:34 Arctic and to the Baltic Sea. Show you
06:37 

06:37 up up to up to north of the Baltic Sea
06:40 

06:40 that way. Um it is currently unknown
06:42 

06:42 whether the submarines that sabotage the
06:45 

06:45 Nord one the Nordstream one and two
06:48 

06:48 pipelines um possibly in order to force
06:51 

06:51 u Europe to stop supporting Ukraine. No
06:54 

06:54 one really knows um who cut those
06:57 

06:57 pipelines. NATO is conducting exercises
06:59 

06:59 in the Black Sea to protect the ships.
07:05 

07:05 Now, I looked up uh the notes that are
07:08 

07:08 available for you, many, many different
07:10 

07:10 notes. Uh here's a student who has
07:12 

07:12 assiduously done 25 pages of written
07:15 

07:15 notes on what I said. You could study
07:18 

07:18 the 25 pages, but I think it's actually
07:20 

07:20 easier and faster just to listen to the
07:22 

07:22 lecture once or twice. Some students
07:24 

07:24 listen to it twice um and not make a
07:27 

07:27 whole transcript and study the
07:28 

07:28 transcript. The transcript is only
07:30 

07:30 necessary if you're going to cheat using
07:32 

07:32 chat and you're going to look up the the
07:34 

07:34 answers. But there I'm going to foil you
07:36 

07:36 again and I'll show you how
07:39 

07:39 because I just look and see every time I
07:41 

07:41 do the lecture I do different stuff. I
07:42 

07:42 say different things here. I'm not
07:44 

07:44 saying that today. I haven't said
07:45 

07:45 anything about that. I did last year say
07:48 

07:48 that it might be the Russians but but we
07:50 

07:50 don't really know.
07:53 

07:53 So that student's notes here's um well
07:55 

07:55 these are the notes from chat. So all I
07:57 

07:57 did is type in who you let's say there
07:58 

07:58 was a question that on the multiple
08:00 

08:00 choice who cut the Nord one and Nord two
08:03 

08:03 pipelines. You can cheat but then chat's
08:05 

08:05 going to give you a tremendous amount of
08:06 

08:06 information that you have to read during
08:08 

08:08 a multiple choice exam. Right now nobody
08:10 

08:10 knows no one knows who got those
08:12 

08:12 pipelines and and this is kind of
08:15 

08:15 interesting.
08:17 

08:17 You can read that but you don't have
08:19 

08:19 time during multiple choice exam.
08:22 

08:22 Okay. As each day passes the nuclear
08:24 

08:24 threats Putin has made of which there
08:27 

08:27 are more and more are veiled in I would
08:30 

08:30 say um grandiosity but they have neither
08:33 

08:33 we the question is whether deterrence
08:35 

08:35 has been weakened or strengthened. And
08:37 

08:37 our guest speaker is going to address
08:39 

08:39 that. He's going to argue that
08:41 

08:41 deterrence has prevented Putin from
08:44 

08:44 attacking NATO. Is he right or is he
08:47 

08:47 wrong? Let's listen to the guest threat
08:49 

08:49 speaker. Is the threat of an above
08:51 

08:51 ground demonstration shot of a nuclear
08:53 

08:53 weapon in Russia's far east more or less
08:56 

08:56 credible? Nobody knows. Nobody knows.
08:60 

08:60 Opinions vary. Maybe it is more likely
09:03 

09:03 that nuclear weapons would be used today
09:05 

09:05 after the attack using nuclear capable
09:07 

09:07 missile on Kev. Or maybe it was more
09:10 

09:10 likely in 2022 in February 2022 when
09:13 

09:13 they first invaded Kev. Unlikely events
09:17 

09:17 happen all the time. They do. And that's
09:19 

09:19 my argument, my counterargument to Guy
09:22 

09:22 Roberts is that if a nuclear war was to
09:25 

09:25 happen, even though it's an unlikely
09:26 

09:26 event, it would lead, it could trigger a
09:28 

09:28 nuclear winter.
09:31 

09:31 I'm going to talk more about what all
09:32 

09:32 this means in a few minute few minutes.
09:34 

09:34 Nuclear threats are always a bluff until
09:37 

09:37 the day they are not. And President
09:39 

09:39 Putin aggressive threats lower the
09:42 

09:42 threshold for nuclear use. So we'll say
09:45 

09:45 lower the threshold of the ladder of
09:47 

09:47 escalation. It makes it more likely that
09:50 

09:50 they will escalate. It will increase. It
09:53 

09:53 will decrease. The argument goes back
09:55 

09:55 and forth back and forth. But
09:57 

09:57 essentially we use the words escalation
09:59 

09:59 and threshold. I'm not sure why.
10:04 

10:04 Okay. Okay, so the arguments made that
10:06 

10:06 winter is always coming and Russia is
10:08 

10:08 superior um in terms of its choke hold
10:11 

10:11 on European gas which they need in the
10:13 

10:13 winter and also they have superior
10:15 

10:15 equipment training in the Arctic and so
10:17 

10:17 on and so that means that they can
10:19 

10:19 mobilize more easily. They have a
10:21 

10:21 conventional um uh advantage and that's
10:23 

10:23 always the traditional argument that was
10:25 

10:25 made especially in 2022 but now the
10:28 

10:28 Ukrainians have received literally
10:30 

10:30 billions of dollars of sophisticated
10:32 

10:32 weapons. We'll talk more about the kinds
10:34 

10:34 of weapons in future weeks, especially
10:36 

10:36 when we talk about NATO, but they've
10:38 

10:38 received these weapons from Canada, the
10:40 

10:40 United States, um, from all over Europe.
10:42 

10:42 And why? Because Europeans are afraid of
10:45 

10:45 another World War II, World War I, the
10:48 

10:48 horror of mass graves, seeing torture
10:50 

10:50 dead bodies, seeing the use of Russian,
10:53 

10:53 even North Korean uh, soldiers and
10:56 

10:56 mercenaries prisoners. This removes the
10:59 

10:59 western the west's reluctance to ratchet
11:02 

11:02 up the conflict by by filling the
11:05 

11:05 Ukrainian war chest.
11:08 

11:08 Okay, so let me explain that further.
11:12 

11:12 Here we can see um Kim Jong-un of North
11:15 

11:15 Korea and the poorly equipped and poorly
11:18 

11:18 trained North Korean soldiers being sent
11:21 

11:21 to fight Russia, the ally, North Korea's
11:25 

11:25 ally. And there they are being sent off
11:27 

11:27 to fight against the Ukrainians
11:32 

11:32 as well. Um the Russians have been using
11:36 

11:36 prisoners, their own prisoners, uh to
11:38 

11:38 fight in the first wave that first
11:41 

11:41 attacks Ukrainians conventionally. Uh
11:44 

11:44 here in 2022 is um uh Ygny Posian and he
11:51 

11:51 has since been killed. uh he was killed
11:53 

11:53 in a in a plane crash, but he did try to
11:57 

11:57 um I wrote an entire column on this the
11:60 

11:60 day after it happened. He it seems like
12:01 

12:01 he tried to um do a civil overtake of
12:06 

12:06 even of of Moscow, but we don't know. Uh
12:09 

12:09 here's a picture of a Russian prisoner
12:10 

12:10 who was uh deployed on the front,
12:13 

12:13 released, and went back home and
12:15 

12:15 murdered two more people. Uh so they're
12:18 

12:18 using prisoners um to fight
12:23 

12:23 already this is a war of attrition and
12:26 

12:26 attrition means trying to wear each
12:27 

12:27 other down and experts count experts
12:31 

12:31 caution that Putin kind of like they'll
12:34 

12:34 use the term a desperate cornered rat
12:36 

12:36 may use nuclear weapons to force the
12:38 

12:38 enemy to back down. This is a very
12:40 

12:40 popular American argument and it is also
12:42 

12:42 part Americans will always refer to this
12:45 

12:45 escalating to deescalate. In fact, Guy
12:48 

12:48 Roberts refers to it and then I have to
12:50 

12:50 correct him. It's escalating to
12:52 

12:52 deescalate. You shouldn't really uh
12:54 

12:54 correct famous speakers. The White
12:56 

12:56 House's warnings are stark. The people
12:58 

12:58 in the United States are stark. Even
13:01 

13:01 outgoing US when he was outgoing US
13:03 

13:03 President Biden made clear at the UN
13:05 

13:05 General Assembly and there's a link
13:07 

13:07 there in the PowerPoint slides to his
13:09 

13:09 speech, but you do not need to listen to
13:11 

13:11 his speech. That was one of his last
13:13 

13:13 speeches at the UN. And that's what he
13:16 

13:16 what what he's saying is that we have to
13:18 

13:18 meet these challenges and build a future
13:21 

13:21 uh rhetoric um of cooperation.
13:27 

13:27 President Biden's secretary of state. So
13:29 

13:29 this is the first time I introduced the
13:30 

13:30 word secretary of state. We have
13:33 

13:33 minister of foreign affairs. They have
13:36 

13:36 secretaries. Okay? So keep that in mind.
13:39 

13:39 And they refer to a state department. So
13:42 

13:42 here you have um Anthony Blinken who was
13:44 

13:44 the US Secretary of State. Boy, it would
13:46 

13:46 be good to have him as a guest speaker,
13:48 

13:48 right? Um he could come in. He'd be
13:50 

13:50 pretty jaundest and angry. Um anyway, he
13:53 

13:53 said that they told Moscow that that
13:56 

13:56 they cannot use nuclear weapons that
13:58 

13:58 it's very important.
13:60 

13:60 Um
14:01 

14:01 why is it doing that? I don't know. We
14:04 

14:04 may any use of nuclear weapons would
14:05 

14:05 have catastrophic effects. We know that
14:08 

14:08 President Trump is also afraid of
14:10 

14:10 nuclear weapon use. He has said many
14:12 

14:12 times that he is very fearful of nuclear
14:15 

14:15 war and he has issued probably we think
14:18 

14:18 probably similar warnings to Putin but
14:20 

14:20 we don't know.
14:23 

14:23 Moving on. Um the US President Donald
14:25 

14:25 Trump has authorized attacks on nuclear
14:28 

14:28 sites in Iran and these were authorized
14:31 

14:31 in June on June 22nd 2025. So they sent
14:36 

14:36 American planes from the United States
14:39 

14:39 from the Whiteman air base all the way
14:41 

14:41 over
14:43 

14:43 to Iran. So to these actually three
14:45 

14:45 sites here. Need a better highlighter.
14:52 

14:52 Here's some um other attacks or no these
14:55 

14:55 are the sort of same attacks. This is
14:56 

14:56 according to CNN um on June 22nd, 2025.
15:01 

15:01 So I put that there. I'm fiddling here
15:02 

15:02 with the the laser pointer. I finally
15:05 

15:05 got it. So, we don't really we actually
15:07 

15:07 don't know much since what's happened to
15:09 

15:09 the Iran um nuclear uh sites. We don't
15:12 

15:12 know if they're working. We don't know
15:13 

15:13 very much because we're we don't know.
15:16 

15:16 Moving on. But what I want to draw
15:18 

15:18 attention to is the secretary of state
15:20 

15:20 who is um Marco Rubio. What he said is
15:25 

15:25 that this was limited. It was targeted.
15:27 

15:27 They didn't want to become involved in
15:29 

15:29 the Iran Israel conflict. they were
15:32 

15:32 doing so in order to destroy the three
15:35 

15:35 nuclear weapons sites that were he said
15:40 

15:40 here it's not an attack on Iran or Iran
15:41 

15:41 and people it's not a regime change move
15:44 

15:44 so that's that attack let me just
15:47 

15:47 elaborate further with the next slide
15:50 

15:50 here uh Senator Marco Rubio he was a
15:54 

15:54 Republican who ran a very young man who
15:57 

15:57 ran against Donald Trump compared to
15:59 

15:59 Donald Trump who who's nearly 80. Um
16:03 

16:03 Trump refers to him as a kid now. Him
16:05 

16:05 and uh Rubio and uh Vance he refers to
16:09 

16:09 lately as kids. He was slated to become
16:11 

16:11 the new secretary of state. So here's
16:13 

16:13 the United States Department of of of
16:15 

16:15 State.
16:17 

16:17 You don't need to memorize organization
16:19 

16:19 chart. I'm just trying to show you that
16:20 

16:20 there's a structure. The State
16:22 

16:22 Department.
16:24 

16:24 Okay, moving on. Here's President
16:26 

16:26 Jonathan uh Vice President Jonathan Van.
16:29 

16:29 Slept there. uh Jonathan Vance and
16:31 

16:31 Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Uh
16:34 

16:34 they're arguing that the US president
16:37 

16:37 can strike without congressional
16:39 

16:39 authority against nuclear and non-uclear
16:42 

16:42 armed states which goes against the NPT
16:44 

16:44 treaty which I'll talk about in uh
16:46 

16:46 lesson 2B. Uh here he's saying that um
16:51 

16:51 the president has authority to act
16:53 

16:53 against proliferation of WMDs. how
16:55 

16:55 that's how they refer to weapons of mass
16:57 

16:57 destruction which are nuclear,
16:59 

16:59 biological, chemical, radiological
17:01 

17:01 weapons.
17:04 

17:04 So we will be listening to the former US
17:07 

17:07 assistant secretary of defense in in the
17:09 

17:09 what President Trump now calls the war
17:11 

17:11 department but at that time was called
17:13 

17:13 the defense department. So it's called
17:15 

17:15 the war department. Uh now I've
17:18 

17:18 interviewed him um five times for my
17:21 

17:21 classes. In one of the classes he talked
17:23 

17:23 and he recommended this book the day
17:25 

17:25 after but not in this interview for this
17:27 

17:27 class this this but I do recommend that
17:30 

17:30 you actually look at the book. So there
17:32 

17:32 he is when he was the former US
17:34 

17:34 assistant secretary of defense for
17:35 

17:35 nuclear, biological and chemical
17:37 

17:37 weapons.
17:40 

17:40 Let us now look at President Putin's
17:42 

17:42 speech. You can take a read of it the
17:44 

17:44 actual transcript. It's quite shocking
17:46 

17:46 actually because he speaks very clearly
17:49 

17:49 about why he's ordering the mobilization
17:52 

17:52 of 300,000 Russians and many they're
17:56 

17:56 estimating that 500,000 Russians have
17:59 

17:59 died but they're they're not releasing
18:01 

18:01 the statistics so we don't know. He said
18:04 

18:04 that they would use all the means at our
18:05 

18:05 disposal. Does that mean nuclear weapons
18:08 

18:08 to defend its territory? and he talked a
18:11 

18:11 lot about neo-Nazis and the need to to
18:14 

18:14 combat the neo-Nazi coupointed
18:17 

18:17 coupointed regime in Ukraine.
18:22 

18:22 In my other classes, we talk more um in
18:24 

18:24 the global violence class about the
18:26 

18:26 roots of um the the uh Ukraine and the
18:29 

18:29 regime changes there and so on. But
18:31 

18:31 here, all I want to do in this class for
18:32 

18:32 Canada abroad is is just return to the
18:35 

18:35 siege of Lennengrad, which is now called
18:38 

18:38 St. Petersburg. That's when Putin, he
18:40 

18:40 was born there and he grew up listening
18:43 

18:43 to the tales from World War II of over a
18:46 

18:46 million people dying mainly from
18:48 

18:48 starvation. So he is paranoid. He seems
18:51 

18:51 to be incredibly violent. He holds all
18:54 

18:54 the levers of power and he is not
18:56 

18:56 subject to democracy. He's not beholden
18:59 

18:59 to others in his inner circle and is
19:01 

19:01 what we sometimes say inner cabal. He's
19:04 

19:04 not beholden to anyone.
19:07 

19:07 A theme here is Thomas Hobbs pictured
19:10 

19:10 here. Thomas Hobbes, history is replete
19:13 

19:13 with evidence that nine knives can come
19:16 

19:16 out and stab from within the inner
19:18 

19:18 circle. Stab the strongest in the back.
19:20 

19:20 That's the lesson of Thomas Hobbes. Some
19:23 

19:23 are stronger than others, but the
19:25 

19:25 weakest though through cunning can still
19:28 

19:28 kill the strongest. He wrote that during
19:31 

19:31 the civil war in England. The account as
19:33 

19:33 well in the King James Bible of the last
19:36 

19:36 supper highlights Judas's betrayal, one
19:38 

19:38 of the disciples in the um New Testament
19:42 

19:42 betrayal of Jesus. So what are the other
19:45 

19:45 betrayals in history?
19:48 

19:48 President Trump feels very betrayed not
19:51 

19:51 just by President Biden and by Camala
19:53 

19:53 Harris and by the fact that he says he
19:56 

19:56 lost the 2020 election. He feels
19:58 

19:58 betrayed by his closest aids from Steve
20:01 

20:01 Bannon uh to um his own daughter who
20:05 

20:05 testified Aana that she did not believe
20:08 

20:08 her father's claims that the 2020
20:10 

20:10 election was stolen. There she is
20:12 

20:12 testifying. So there are legions of
20:15 

20:15 legendary stories of betrayal because in
20:18 

20:18 their pursuit of power leaders cast
20:20 

20:20 aside what we call sycopants. Sycophants
20:24 

20:24 are people who are manipulating because
20:27 

20:27 toward power the rasputins of the world.
20:30 

20:30 They want they want power and so they
20:32 

20:32 manipulate the leader and they become
20:34 

20:34 sick of fans. They tell the leader what
20:36 

20:36 they want to hear.
20:41 

20:41 Okay. So only vengeful and irrational
20:44 

20:44 followers could fully support any
20:47 

20:47 decision by President Putin or President
20:50 

20:50 Trump to use nuclear weapons. And why is
20:53 

20:53 that? That is because of the nuclear
20:56 

20:56 taboo. It is the word nuclear taboo has
20:58 

20:58 become stronger in the United States
21:01 

21:01 since the Cuban missile crisis because
21:03 

21:03 there's so much known about the effects
21:06 

21:06 of a nuclear winter. Even from the use
21:09 

21:09 of 50 or 100 small tactical nuclear
21:12 

21:12 weapons, merely 0.3% of the world's
21:15 

21:15 arsenal.
21:18 

21:18 I will be talking a little bit more
21:20 

21:20 about nuclear winter today uh because
21:22 

21:22 it's important for you to understand the
21:23 

21:23 nuclear taboo. If there was a nuclear
21:26 

21:26 winter using only approximately 50 to
21:28 

21:28 100 nuclear weapons, global famine would
21:31 

21:31 result along with the collapse of the
21:33 

21:33 entire world's economy and the
21:35 

21:35 destruction of 45 to 70% of the ozone
21:39 

21:39 layer above us. These are facts that any
21:42 

21:42 Russian briefing book or any Chinese or
21:45 

21:45 any any briefing book would tell a
21:48 

21:48 leader. Everyone knows that this may be
21:51 

21:51 why China's leader, President Xi
21:54 

21:54 Shenpang and India's Prime Minister
21:57 

21:57 Narenda Modi are preaching caution to
22:01 

22:01 Putin and probably President Trump
22:03 

22:03 directly. They are not mincing their
22:05 

22:05 cautionary words. They're behind the
22:08 

22:08 scenes probably being very cautious.
22:13 

22:13 But we don't know the nuclear taboo and
22:16 

22:16 fear that Putin's legacy would be of
22:18 

22:18 human history's most deranged and
22:20 

22:20 despicable man. Past Adolf Hitler, past
22:23 

22:23 Stalin, who killed the most humans in
22:26 

22:26 history, uh, Joseph Stalin. Uh, anyway,
22:31 

22:31 that that that that he would go down in
22:34 

22:34 history if there was a history. And in
22:36 

22:36 Russia, therefore, there is opposition
22:37 

22:37 in the cities and remote villages in
22:40 

22:40 far-flung regions where they're
22:42 

22:42 mobilizing the poor rural men uh from
22:45 

22:45 the tiny villages to become cannon
22:48 

22:48 fodder, meaning to become used as as
22:51 

22:51 cannon fodder. It's a phrase that we
22:53 

22:53 use. The leadership wants to win a
22:56 

22:56 conventional ground war. That's certain
22:58 

22:58 like those that fought during World War
23:00 

23:00 II in Europe. But of course, the
23:03 

23:03 spectre, the terrible spectre of a
23:05 

23:05 demonstration shot, which is what
23:08 

23:08 President Putin has done now with this
23:10 

23:10 nuclear capable but armed with dummy
23:13 

23:13 missiles, not with nuclear weapons, but
23:14 

23:14 he's doing a demonstration shot. And the
23:17 

23:17 next shot might be using an actual
23:20 

23:20 nuclear weapons perhaps in the Arctic.
23:23 

23:23 We don't know. So, the United States is
23:25 

23:25 the only only power that has ever used
23:28 

23:28 nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and
23:29 

23:29 Nagasaki. We'll talk about that in
23:31 

23:31 lesson 2C. In order and they did so in
23:34 

23:34 order to show their military power.
23:37 

23:37 Right-wingers, people who support Putin,
23:40 

23:40 sickopants may argue that using nuclear
23:42 

23:42 weapons is inevitable.
23:46 

23:46 Okay, I'm going at quite a speed, but I
23:47 

23:47 think that you need to we need to go
23:49 

23:49 back in history a little bit and talk
23:50 

23:50 about President John F. Kennedy pictured
23:53 

23:53 here speaking himself to the UN General
23:56 

23:56 Assembly. So leaders always take it very
23:58 

23:58 seriously. You can listen to all their
24:00 

24:00 speeches and read the transcripts and
24:03 

24:03 you can read what they say. What did
24:05 

24:05 Kennedy say? That all of us are uh
24:07 

24:07 living under a nuclear sword of dam
24:10 

24:10 democ democles democles
24:14 

24:14 hanging by the slanderest of threads
24:16 

24:16 capable of being cut at any moment by
24:19 

24:19 accident miscalculation or by madness.
24:22 

24:22 Isn't that apt that he's saying that the
24:25 

24:25 weapons of war must be abolished before
24:28 

24:28 they abolish us? So they're using the
24:30 

24:30 word abolition.
24:34 

24:34 The nuclear journey the nuclear genie is
24:37 

24:37 out of the bottle. The nuclear genie
24:39 

24:39 which means that the knowledge to build
24:42 

24:42 your own nuclear weapon is freely
24:44 

24:44 available on the nuclear uh on the on
24:46 

24:46 the internet. And it will take
24:48 

24:48 generations to abolish nuclear weapons.
24:50 

24:50 There's no doubt it will take many
24:52 

24:52 generations. But the norm of nonuse of
24:55 

24:55 nonuse since the United States used
24:58 

24:58 nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and
25:01 

25:01 Nagasaki in World War II can act as a
25:04 

25:04 powerful restraint on leaders. Nobody
25:06 

25:06 wants to go down in history being seen
25:09 

25:09 as the the most reprehensible leader in
25:11 

25:11 history that led to the end of the
25:13 

25:13 world.
25:14 

25:14 So it also it exerted a strong effect on
25:17 

25:17 the XCOM the executive committee uh way
25:19 

25:19 back in 1962.
25:24 

25:24 Okay. The nuclear genie is out of the
25:25 

25:25 bottle. And many students will argue
25:27 

25:27 with me okay well you know uh AK can
25:30 

25:30 from Pakistan he sold all the
25:32 

25:32 technology. He got the technology and he
25:34 

25:34 sold the he sold the um technology and
25:38 

25:38 so there's going to be nuclear
25:39 

25:39 proliferation. Iran is going to
25:41 

25:41 demonstrate its nuclear prowess in its
25:44 

25:44 war against Israel. South Korea may
25:47 

25:47 develop its own nuclear weapons. It's
25:48 

25:48 interesting to hear Guy Roberts talking
25:50 

25:50 about South Korea uh leading Japan to
25:53 

25:53 counter because North Korea already
25:55 

25:55 tested its nuclear own nuclear weapons.
25:57 

25:57 So Japan would Japan many people say
25:60 

25:60 Japan is the closest to openly uh saying
26:02 

26:02 that it's going to develop its nuclear
26:04 

26:04 weapons. But because they were the first
26:07 

26:07 to and only countries to experience
26:09 

26:09 nuclear war uh nuclear attack um they
26:12 

26:12 may not do so. In any case the arms race
26:15 

26:15 will spread and proliferate.
26:20 

26:20 Still it remains uh reprehensible uh
26:22 

26:22 that when countries have nuclear
26:24 

26:24 arsenals they think and they plan about
26:27 

26:27 using and modernizing these expensive
26:30 

26:30 weapons. They think about how to make
26:32 

26:32 them usable, smaller, precisiong guided
26:36 

26:36 munitions, targetable. They talk about
26:38 

26:38 the 1950s when the David Crockett and
26:42 

26:42 Honest John nuclear weapons and the
26:44 

26:44 Canadian named Lacrosse nuclear weapons
26:46 

26:46 were smaller.
26:49 

26:49 Arguably, it will not be until all the
26:52 

26:52 nine nuclear all the countries with
26:54 

26:54 nuclear weapons, all the nuclear weapons
26:56 

26:56 states, the nine, participate in the new
26:59 

26:59 treaty on the prohibition of nuclear
27:01 

27:01 weapons, the TPNW.
27:03 

27:03 That is a binding global agreement. 93
27:06 

27:06 countries have signed and ratified it
27:09 

27:09 and they've agreed to prohibit and not
27:11 

27:11 stock and not stockpile and not host
27:13 

27:13 nuclear weapons. arguably when that
27:16 

27:16 happens that we'll then we'll get back
27:18 

27:18 on a diplomatic track of nuclear risk
27:22 

27:22 reduction that makes a safer world. So
27:25 

27:25 here's the TPNW pictured in front of the
27:27 

27:27 UN flags in New York City and I've been
27:29 

27:29 there many times to the NPT review
27:32 

27:32 conferences and I've never been to the
27:34 

27:34 TPNW because Canada is not a part of
27:37
