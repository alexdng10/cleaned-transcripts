00:01 welcome to a lecture on uh how to meet
00:04 and greet at receptions we're going to
00:07 talk about how to make conversation
00:08 during a reception how to introduce
00:11 yourself how to introduce yourself at
00:13 length how to talk when you're at a
00:15 diplomatic reception carrying a lot of
00:17 things including your business card how
00:19 to follow up by email and then also a
00:22 little bit on how to ask for a letter of
00:23 reference from a professor and which
00:25 professors to ask
00:30 I've put some sample questions here to
00:33 help you you will be very nervous when
00:35 you meet an important person like Oprah
00:37 Winfrey President Obama President Biden
00:41 prime minister Trudeau pictured here and
00:43 so I've memorized these questions and I
00:45 urge you to memorize the following
00:48 questions as well to use when you're in
00:51 a circle in a diplomatic Circle and
00:53 people ask you to keep the conversation
00:56 going so you could ask an elder States
00:59 person you know what the newspapers and
01:01 magazines that you can't live without
01:03 and they will read a lot every day and
01:05 they'll tell you at length about it
01:07 listen and listen and
01:09 listen um people are uh you could ask
01:12 them what are their favorite books
01:14 that's a long answer um and it might be
01:16 only if there's only one person there
01:19 but you could also ask them what writers
01:21 influence them and if they're a lawyer
01:23 or a chief executive officer CEO you
01:27 could ask them about a law that they
01:29 created
01:33 if you're in an international uh uh
01:36 reception and you want to make
01:38 conversation with people who where
01:40 English might not be their their first
01:42 language it might be more difficult for
01:44 them to understand what you're saying
01:46 then it is better to go back to easy
01:48 questions so I put some questions here
01:51 uh that are kind of easier depending on
01:54 uh who you're speaking to what are the
01:56 sources of your best ideas uh let's say
01:59 you were talking with someone who who
02:01 could not speak English very well then
02:03 you can talk about a trend usually
02:06 people will talk about AI don't talk
02:09 about sports don't talk about the Blue
02:11 Jays because people only remember that
02:13 you talked about sports what was the
02:16 most important thing that they learned
02:18 not what you learned because you always
02:19 want to be listening to what they have
02:21 learned not what you have
02:24 learned in terms of uh your brief
02:27 introductions I would like you to
02:28 picture in your mind some typical scenes
02:31 at a reception and I want you to think
02:33 about how you would hold your briefcase
02:36 let's say you're carrying a purse you're
02:38 also carrying let's say a drink or we
02:41 used to practice in my in-person classes
02:43 with teacups and spoons and you also
02:46 have to make conversation you may be
02:48 wearing uh uncomfortable clothing you
02:50 may be tired you may be wearing high
02:52 heels that are painful and when
02:55 everybody is looking at you you need to
02:58 look and think about what they are
02:59 seeing so I put some pictures here of
03:03 Camala Harris during the debate with uh
03:06 president
03:09 Trump she was complimented for how she
03:12 approached president Trump during the
03:14 televised debate she was wearing quite
03:16 high heels and she walked a stroe toward
03:19 him and put her hand out to his height
03:22 and then she shook it that was a very
03:25 important point in the de debate and it
03:27 told us a lot she must have been
03:29 extremely nervous although she's spoken
03:31 before and that's why I urge you to
03:34 remember the five W's so just say to
03:37 yourself in that kind of um atmosphere
03:39 what where when why what am I going to
03:44 say just say anything to yourself if you
03:47 are nervous focus on a box like a
03:50 computer or a window and practice
03:53 breathing in looking along one edge of
03:56 the box and breathing out and breathing
03:58 in and breathing brething out so you go
04:01 around the box trying to calm your mind
04:04 I'd like you to practice that if you can
04:06 if you have a lot of anxiety remember
04:08 that people will not see that your legs
04:10 are shaking they will not see that you
04:13 are perspiring they will not notice if
04:15 you are if your hands are actually
04:17 trembling uh you might think that
04:19 they're seeing all that that they're
04:20 hearing that your voice is shaking but
04:23 actually they're just focusing on you
04:25 and your body language and what you're
04:26 saying
04:30 I put a picture here of a reception so
04:33 what you need to think about is what are
04:34 you going to say and where do you work
04:37 let's say or when have you been working
04:39 and what why are you working on
04:41 something nobody will be shaking no one
04:44 will will will worry at all if you're
04:46 shaking in your
04:48 boots most of the time in in a this is
04:51 at the United Nations uh I I believe
04:53 yeah people are wearing ties no this is
04:55 not the United Nations but anyway I had
04:57 another picture of the UN often you have
04:59 to look down at their chest to see who
05:02 they are you can't go over and flip the
05:05 you can't flip their placard to see who
05:07 they are but you can ask them oh can I
05:09 see that more closely and they'll lift
05:11 it up and show it to
05:17 you practice your introductions of
05:20 yourself in front of a mirror look up
05:22 when you answer the phone so when you
05:24 answer the phone look up and say your
05:27 name and what you're doing and it will
05:28 make your voice sound more friendly and
05:31 positive pretend to exchange a business
05:34 card in the mirror with both hands
05:36 trying to look friendly where are you
05:38 going to put their business card are you
05:39 going to put it in your pocket or are
05:41 you in your
05:45 purse exchanging business cards uh I
05:48 suggest that you uh develop a business
05:50 card now uh that has a permanent address
05:53 your home a permanent address not a
05:55 temporary address that changes all the
05:56 time I suggest that you carry them with
05:59 you always
06:00 in your um uh purse and that you
06:04 practice exchanging them with other
06:06 people so we used to practice in my
06:08 class for example if you're exchanging
06:10 them uh with um Asian people how would
06:14 you bow and you present it often uh they
06:16 will look at the whole business card in
06:19 front of you examining it very closely
06:22 uh do you want to put your cell phone
06:24 number on your business card I have
06:26 three business cards only one has my
06:28 cell phone number on it because I want
06:30 to uh and then one has my business card
06:33 and so on so think about uh whether you
06:36 need more than one business card I
06:38 actually have a false business card one
06:40 that has a false cell phone number on it
06:42 just so that I can give it to people who
06:44 I really don't want um to continue to
06:47 because they'll often ask well can I
06:48 have your cell phone number well here it
06:49 is no thank
06:51 you okay um is the North American
06:54 introductory gesture the basic handshake
06:56 dead well as we uh it doesn't oh my face
06:60 is there and that's why we're not using
07:01 my face in future you'll see I don't use
07:03 it anymore cuz I need every little bit
07:05 of space here but experts estimate that
07:08 80 to 9 90% of communication is
07:12 nonverbal it's body language so it's how
07:15 you portray yourself that people
07:17 remember and that has the most
07:19 information for them so what about your
07:21 handshake what about the basic handshake
07:25 it is definitely not dead and in my
07:27 classes we used to practice in person to
07:31 hand shake hands and give each other
07:33 feedback what I'd like you to do this
07:35 week is to give uh your family and
07:37 friends feedback and ask them to give
07:39 you feedback about your handshake so
07:42 reach forward with your right hand and
07:45 aim for the triangle in their hand which
07:47 is right here aim for that triangle and
07:50 press against it people will actually
07:53 think that they trust you because they
07:55 can feel you pressing with that triangle
07:58 against their hand don't do a fishy
08:01 handshake what's a fishy handshake
08:04 that's when you have a very weak
08:05 handshake like that it's just so weak it
08:08 tells people a lot of women will
08:10 deliberately have a very weak handshake
08:13 and that is something that you need to
08:15 train yourself not to do if I can give
08:16 you some advice so the basic handshake
08:19 you squeeze their handshake you don't
08:21 just put your fingers in there like a
08:22 dead fish and you go up and down and
08:25 then you release you do not continue to
08:27 do that which is sort of domineering um
08:30 as well some people do a kind of a basic
08:32 die a a um a bow which you see the
08:36 governor general uh packet doing here
08:38 with the First Nations person uh so
08:41 practice what you're going to do and
08:43 then use your fingers as given says here
08:46 as sort of antenna to pick up how long
08:49 you're going to keep shaking hands with
08:50 the people now I have very cold hands so
08:53 I often will go before a reception and I
08:56 will jump up and down in the bathroom
08:58 trying to make my hands warm warm
08:60 because if people shake my hands you can
09:01 see this look of horror across their
09:03 face because they think she's like a
09:05 cold cold Maiden ice maiden and so
09:08 sometimes I'll say if I still have very
09:10 cold hands C you know I can see their
09:12 face cold hands warm heart you uh
09:15 because um you don't want and also if
09:19 you have a death what's called a death
09:20 grip try to to to loosen
09:24 it okay after the pandemic uh we were
09:27 seeing more different creative types of
09:29 hand shapes
09:30 uh the elbow or the fist bump where you
09:33 just are doing that so there's Boris
09:35 Johnson doing the uh looks like the the
09:38 elbow and the fist
09:40 pump you can also politely say uh you
09:44 can compl completely bow so if let let's
09:46 say you're here in an airport or in a
09:49 terminal and you and you're not really
09:50 sure that you want to start shaking
09:52 hands there's nothing wrong with just
09:54 stepping back a bit and and you'll
09:56 notice that a lot of Muslim women will
09:58 will will Not Shake Hands with a man
10:00 they'll put their hand like this and
10:02 they'll bow slightly uh with their hand
10:04 over their heart uh so here you can see
10:06 King Charles whom you would always
10:08 address as King Charles and queen Camila
10:11 his uh concert bowing they have to shake
10:14 hands a
10:15 lot practice with your friends this week
10:18 if you can uh here's John Kennedy uh
10:20 shaking hands with the young Bill
10:22 Clinton obviously uh he there he is
10:26 pushing down a little bit and then
10:28 behind my my face face which is such a
10:30 nuisance and believe me we will not be
10:32 using my face in future you can see Bill
10:35 uh Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton
10:39 and also uh Donald Trump when they were
10:45 younger you can always decline the basic
10:47 handshake if you don't feel like shaking
10:49 hands with someone you can wave or you
10:51 can smile you do not need to actually
10:53 shake
10:54 hands the two-handed shake let me go
10:57 over that just quickly uh this is a
10:59 where you shake their hand and then you
11:01 put your hand on top a little bit uh so
11:03 as to be more friendly and this is
11:05 showing emotion uh it could be that you
11:09 here's president Trump and I have
11:10 another picture here I think he's good
11:13 at doing it uh but I suggest that you
11:15 use it sparingly he's an older man with
11:18 a great deal of power so here he is with
11:20 uh prime minister AB from Japan and he
11:23 held on to his hand for 19 minutes
11:26 shaking it up and down holding on to it
11:29 this is a the end of the 19 minutes uh
11:31 so you can do that and a lot of
11:33 communication is happening there about
11:35 power and
11:38 friendship here's uh president Trump um
11:41 also with this is when they were he was
11:43 running against uh Hillary Clinton and
11:46 uh you can see there the basic handshake
11:49 with the shake and grab now this I
11:52 advise you not to use it in a
11:53 professional setting it can be used to
11:56 show who the dominant person is if you
11:58 push down or if it's an underling if you
12:01 shake hands and you push down in an
12:03 elevator pushing down uh so that's that
12:06 tells a lot uh the pat it down uh among
12:10 women this is often where you put your
12:12 hand forward and you're not quite giving
12:14 them a hug but you're patting them on
12:16 the on the shoulder now men will do that
12:19 a lot and given believes men are more
12:21 comfortable about receiving this than
12:23 our women but actually to tell the truth
12:24 I always wear shoulder pads in business
12:27 meetings and people always are grabbing
12:29 me by the shoulder and so on so I I
12:32 never wear I never go to a business
12:33 reception without wearing a business
12:35 suit with but I'm I'm an older woman so
12:38 that's what happens um okay let's keep
12:41 going The Hip Hop hug or pound hug I'm
12:44 not recommending that so you can see
12:46 there don't use this anymore it should
12:48 be shaved it should be saved for your
12:51 friends okay so this is a quick manto
12:54 man greeting and it really has no place
12:56 in a business setting but I wanted to
12:58 put it in there because a lot of view
12:59 Our Generation X and Y and now we have
13:02 the new generation beta coming this year
13:05 and they will be doing different types
13:07 of handshakes for
13:09 sure moving on here kissing um now this
13:12 is this is difficult because a lot of
13:15 times if you're in Europe or if you're
13:17 in Russia uh this is definitely um a
13:21 type among diplomats who who you know uh
13:25 they will grab you and start doing
13:28 what's called air kissing they're not
13:30 actually kissing you they're kissing
13:31 past your shoulder into the air it's
13:34 hard to explain and if sometimes they'll
13:37 do it three times sometimes they'll do
13:39 it twice so you have to remember there
13:41 might be going to go again for the third
13:43 time you can practice it before
13:45 traveling it is not done a lot here in
13:49 North
13:50 America okay how to follow up if you
13:53 meet someone um the first thing that I
13:55 recommend this is just an email I
13:57 grabbed out of a an email from today
14:00 actually um and here I can tell
14:03 immediately that the student might be
14:05 using uh artificial intelligence chat to
14:08 write the email because it says I hope
14:10 this email finds you well and it's
14:12 written in aptose uh uh 12 uh 11 Point
14:16 font so that tells me but on the other
14:19 hand there are some mistakes so there's
14:21 no period after doctor and there's a
14:24 sentence fragment here it doesn't make
14:25 any sense uh there's a strange use of
14:28 the word learnings and they want to
14:31 pursue Graduate Studies based on their
14:33 performance in three seconde classes not
14:36 a good idea because these are online
14:38 courses and as I've said over and over
14:40 again I do not do reference letters
14:42 unless you absolutely have taken four of
14:45 my courses and so I know you very very
14:48 well from the fourth course and you
14:50 absolutely need my reference but in this
14:53 case I have to say no because they're
14:54 trying to do Graduate Studies and the
14:56 questions are asked about integrity a
14:59 question question are asked about how
15:00 I've seen you perform in a live setting
15:02 do you have good roal presentation
15:04 skills sincerity Integrity on and on
15:07 they have many many questions so I would
15:09 have to say no warm regards is also um a
15:13 chat gbt a typical
15:16 signature now when you're addressing
15:18 people uh in a reception or at the
15:20 University campus you need to remember
15:23 what their rank is and there are ranks
15:25 everywhere like in the military Colonels
15:27 and left-handed colonels generals
15:30 Brigadier generals it goes on and on you
15:32 need to kind of study that you can tell
15:33 a lot by their their Insignia on their
15:36 shoulders and their medals but for
15:39 professors it's really actually quite
15:41 hard actually age is the best tell um
15:43 indicator if they're older then they
15:46 might be a retired Professor don't say
15:48 to them oh are you retired yet people
15:50 keep saying to me aren't you retired yet
15:52 extremely insulting don't say that don't
15:54 say that this this professor said that
15:56 to me the other day in the elevator I
15:57 was like please that's like saying are
15:59 you pregnant and then they're not
16:00 pregnant I'm not retired quite yet
16:02 people okay what's a full Professor a
16:05 full Professor can be a distinguished
16:07 professor and they are distinguished
16:09 because of their research their teaching
16:11 and their service and they are very high
16:14 up their salaries are very high up and
16:17 they generally are about 50 to 70 years
16:19 old associate professors are tenured
16:22 they have a job security they work
16:24 full-time and they can't be fired except
16:27 if they do something very very terrible
16:29 so um a an assist I'm an associate
16:32 professor so I'm tenured and I work
16:34 full-time on Research teaching and
16:37 Administration Graduate supervision and
16:39 so on so I have a lot of
16:41 responsibilities not just teaching um
16:44 assistant professor may just have
16:46 teaching responsibilities they may be
16:47 tenure track they don't have tenure yet
16:50 because otherwise they've been an
16:51 associate professor and they may often
16:53 be on a temporary contract they do have
16:55 to have a doctorate they have to have a
16:58 PhD that is complet
16:59 defended now a doctor has a PHD that is
17:03 defended and they have officially
17:04 graduated with what's called a doctorate
17:06 or a
17:09 um doctor of philosophy actually PhD
17:13 there are different doctorates in
17:14 education I don't want to explain those
17:16 those are different uh but a professor
17:18 without a doctorate could be a high
17:21 school teacher so you could refer to a
17:23 fansa college or a high school teacher
17:25 or college teacher as a professor even
17:27 if they don't have their doctor
17:29 it's getting a little confusing that way
17:31 because then you think are they a full
17:32 Professor they could be very old so they
17:35 that reference letter is not as valuable
17:38 on stationary as that done by the
17:40 professor Meritus or the full Professor
17:43 for sure um and so you have to be very
17:46 careful when you ask for references to
17:48 make sure you're asking for references
17:50 from professors who are tenur associate
17:53 or full professors the pr preferably the
17:57 older they are the more senior they are
17:59 the the better for you for your
18:01 reference letters um now a a TA should
18:05 you ask a TA no for a reference letter
18:08 not at all a TA doesn't have uh even an
18:10 MA often um so an MA is a master of arts
18:15 so a TA doesn't have an Ma and so that
18:18 that reference letter is not as is
18:20 certainly not as valuable uh what about
18:22 a ba honors that's a person who has a
18:25 specialty a fouryear specialty in one
18:28 field so they've taken lot of of and and
18:30 now finally the ba the double major much
18:32 more popular now at Western but it does
18:36 close you off from professional programs
18:38 like um a further degree in MA in your
18:42 chosen field but it sometimes it can
18:44 open it up it it really
18:46 depends okay there's a lot of confusion
18:49 there's no rigorous rules but let me add
18:51 that if someone says ABD that means all
18:53 about dissertation it means they they've
18:55 done the coursework for their PHD but
18:57 they have not done their dis ation and
18:60 so it's just ABD it doesn't really mean
19:02 anything um in fact you really shouldn't
19:04 use it on your signature what about if
19:06 you use on your signature Ambassador or
19:09 former Ambassador when I meet
19:10 ambassadors I always call them
19:12 Ambassador even if they're retired
19:14 that's the important thing that you can
19:16 do and you'll see in our class we'll
19:17 have a lot of retired ambassadors and
19:19 you'll hear me continually refer them as
19:22 Ambassador and they are required to say
19:24 no I've retired but then you can
19:26 continue to address them just like a
19:28 member of Parliament you would continue
19:30 to address them as The Honorable Member
19:32 of Parliament uh what about so so a
19:34 former Ambassador I'm covering here you
19:36 should continue to address them as
19:38 Ambassador I'm not going to cover llm
19:40 degrees here that's a lot of different
19:43 um things but let me mention that some
19:45 people have many many letters after
19:47 their name uh the person who I saw who
19:49 had the most was Kelly leech who wrote
19:51 to me once she had 17 letters so in
19:54 addition to doctor she had just so many
19:57 I just looked her up on Wikipedia um
19:60 there she is with and then there's she's
20:01 got more letters so um not on Wikipedia
20:04 now but she did before so I put here
20:07 some people who are calling themselves
20:09 ambassadors but they may not be
20:11 ambassadors in the strictest
20:15 sense okay let's talk now about emails
20:18 uh you can look at different people's
20:19 emails there is are companies that will
20:21 give you graphics and so on you can use
20:23 the Western uh graphic I'll show you in
20:26 a moment I put some some sample ones
20:28 here the phone number is always useful
20:31 uh and as well you can translate it into
20:34 whatever language you want if you want
20:36 and add your Twitter your web your um

21:25 but my confidentially notice my land
21:27 acknowledgement goes on I have one of
21:29 the longer signatures that I've seen but
