00:01 welcome students to the second part of
00:03 

00:03 lesson one so there's always four
00:05 

00:05 lessons and this is the part two of
00:07 

00:07 lesson one which is on the instruments
00:09 

00:09 of foreign policy directed and diluted
00:12 

00:12 multilateralism so I fast forward from
00:15 

00:15 Lester Pearson who was called Mike
00:17 

00:17 Pearson to Jean cran who was another
00:20 

00:20 liberal prime minister of Canada we will
00:23 

00:23 talk about conservative Prime Ministers
00:25 

00:25 like Brian morrone in future weeks as we
00:28 

00:28 tackle different problems but here I
00:31 

00:31 need to talk to you now about Jean
00:34 

00:34 crean's form of liberal
00:36 

00:36 internationalism and also their focus on
00:39 

00:39 directed and diluted
00:42 

00:42 multilateralism you can see the captions
00:44 

00:44 are not very good with PowerPoint you
00:47 

00:47 need to use the YouTube channel in order
00:49 

00:49 to create excellent captions and it's
00:52 

00:52 your responsibility to create those
00:54 

00:54 captions and study them especially if
00:57 

00:57 English is your second language Welcome
00:59 

00:59 to our class this is part
01:02 

01:02 two so the historical background here is
01:06 

01:06 of the Jean cran period which is quite
01:09 

01:09 long if you look at it uh 1993 to
01:12 

01:12 1995 then another 5 years and then
01:15 

01:15 another four years so you can see that
01:18 

01:18 picture there of Jean cren Kim Campbell
01:21 

01:21 Joe Clark and Pierre Elliot Trudeau your
01:24 

01:24 professor has met all of these people
01:26 

01:26 including uh Jeffrey Pearson uh Lester
01:29 

01:29 be Pearson's son
01:30 

01:30 who I was very good friends with um the
01:32 

01:32 only person I never had the honor of
01:34 

01:34 meeting except from very far away was
01:37 

01:37 Pierre Elliot Trudeau I saw him in
01:40 

01:40 Saskatoon saskatch one uh at a
01:42 

01:42 university talk and all the students
01:44 

01:44 threw Tomatoes at him Rotten Tomatoes
01:48 

01:48 because of the cruise missile testing
01:50 

01:50 and we wore black armbands to signify
01:54 

01:54 how AOS we were to the cruise missile
01:56 

01:56 testing anyway these people all of them
02:00 

02:00 are actually uh symbolic of the
02:03 

02:03 multilateralist perspective in Canadian
02:06 

02:06 foreign policy so we're going to learn
02:08 

02:08 about that it
02:09 

02:09 evolved in many ways from Liberal
02:12 

02:12 internationalism so we need to learn
02:14 

02:14 about the main tenants of this before we
02:16 

02:16 do our own
02:17 

02:17 toolbox so can we characterize that
02:20 

02:20 cretum time period well let's talk about
02:22 

02:22 that maybe it is uh directed
02:25 

02:25 multilateralism Team Canada approach
02:27 

02:27 let's explore that more
02:30 

02:30 well I have to introduce now a lot of
02:32 

02:32 new issues because we're getting in we
02:34 

02:34 moved from the 1940s and to the 60s all
02:37 

02:37 the way up to the 1990s where the cran
02:40 

02:40 government remember cran had been a
02:42 

02:42 cabinet minister under Lester B Pearson
02:45 

02:45 and he was very interested in the Arctic
02:48 

02:48 so this is the beginning of Canada
02:50 

02:50 looking northwards and starting to
02:52 

02:52 realize that we have a huge amount of uh
02:56 

02:56 Arctic under our
02:58 

02:58 sovereignty this was when they had a new
03:00 

03:00 Arctic Ambassador her I remember Mary
03:03 

03:03 Simons was nominated and one of my
03:06 

03:06 professors Franklin Griffith had hoped
03:07 

03:07 he'd become the Arctic Ambassador but
03:10 

03:10 instead it came went to a woman U Mary
03:12 

03:12 Simons who is she now she's the governor
03:14 

03:14 general of Canada highest ranking person
03:18 

03:18 um below the queen king below King
03:20 

03:20 Charles and the Queen Elizabeth so
03:23 

03:23 there's the
03:24 

03:24 Arctic there other many many new
03:27 

03:27 Concepts that came in play and you need
03:29 

03:29 to know these if if you want to operate
03:31 

03:31 in the international sphere so cran was
03:34 

03:34 very against being in what he called the
03:37 

03:37 camp follower relationship he didn't
03:39 

03:39 want like President Reagan and and Brian
03:42 

03:42 morrone pictured there he didn't want
03:44 

03:44 Canada to be in that sort of subservient
03:47 

03:47 position he wanted it to be more a
03:50 

03:50 partnership between equals he wanted to
03:52 

03:52 be a Cooperative partner and he was as
03:54 

03:54 I've mentioned before good friends with
03:56 

03:56 Bill
03:57 

03:57 Clinton some other Concepts that I want
03:60 

03:60 to bring up for you to remember are this
04:03 

04:03 idea of
04:04 

04:04 subsidies Canadians started talking
04:07 

04:07 about the subsidies that were being put
04:09 

04:09 in place by the Americans and they
04:11 

04:11 started criticizing us especially
04:14 

04:14 because of our logging and our
04:16 

04:16 subsidization of our forestry and
04:18 

04:18 dumping dumping our uh Forest Products
04:22 

04:22 into the United States so they wanted
04:25 

04:25 and so did we we wanted more
04:27 

04:27 codification of our relationship more
04:29 

04:29 International
04:31 

04:31 law that led to these ideas about NAFTA
04:34 

04:34 now we had the Free Trade Agreement
04:36 

04:36 under Brian morone but NAFTA the North
04:40 

04:40 American free trade agreeement came into
04:42 

04:42 play now and this tried to stop us trade
04:47 

04:47 harassment it was not an insignificant
04:50 

04:50 agreement it it was trying to stop the
04:53 

04:53 American domination of our
04:56 

04:56 trading some other ideas were that we
04:59 

04:59 want wanted Canada wanted to control our
05:02 

05:02 oil and our energy especially in the
05:04 

05:04 north and in western Canada they wanted
05:07 

05:07 to make sure that Canada's oil and
05:10 

05:10 Canada's energy and our huge gas
05:12 

05:12 resources and so on were treated fairly
05:15 

05:15 in North America under the crutching
05:17 

05:17 government there was also a lot of
05:19 

05:19 attention paid to uh Services especially
05:22 

05:22 Canada's Banks we have seven strong
05:25 

05:25 Banks Toronto Dominion Royal Bank and so
05:28 

05:28 on and they were
05:30 

05:30 becoming less competitive against the
05:33 

05:33 many many American Banks now they are
05:36 

05:36 very very strong because of this
05:38 

05:38 initiative and we should be thankful for
05:41 

05:41 that so there's the picture of Jean Cen
05:43 

05:43 and Bill Clinton talking about how they
05:45 

05:45 and they trading and and leveraging and
05:48 

05:48 linking and at the same time the the
05:51 

05:51 global South which I've symbolized here
05:54 

05:54 by this picture the global South was
05:57 

05:57 suffering so the new idea ideas we're
06:00 

06:00 going to get into our um dispute
06:03 

06:03 resolution mechanisms this is a kind of
06:05 

06:05 trendy word for saying let's settle our
06:08 

06:08 conflicts with uh mechanisms they talked
06:11 

06:11 a lot about energy protection of
06:14 

06:14 Canada's energy protection they wanted a
06:17 

06:17 Level Playing Field with agreed upon
06:20 

06:20 labor and environmental standards that's
06:22 

06:22 when we started talking about expansion
06:25 

06:25 of the United Nations security Council
06:27 

06:27 it's expanded we started talking about
06:30 

06:30 opposing the e101 helicopters because
06:33 

06:33 they were too sophisticated Canada
06:35 

06:35 wanted to review NORAD again usually
06:39 

06:39 every 5 years sometimes every 3 years
06:42 

06:42 this was the beginning of the notion of
06:43 

06:43 converting uh bases that were too large
06:46 

06:46 and too costly for the Department of
06:48 

06:48 National Defense into for example
06:51 

06:51 peacekeeping training centers and this
06:53 

06:53 was the idea of democratizing foreign
06:56 

06:56 policy so I bring this up it goes past
06:58 

06:58 you now and maybe later
07:01 

07:01 when you are um traveling the world on
07:03 

07:03 behalf of Canada you will think of these
07:06 

07:06 ideas and they will compete with the
07:08 

07:08 kind of Concepts that you see here this
07:11 

07:11 is a former Eastern European uh City
07:16 

07:16 look at I mean people are just in these
07:18 

07:18 apartments living Dreadful lives no
07:20 

07:20 Parks no no Freedom it's it's very
07:25 

07:25 difficult Canada has a lot of new
07:27 

07:27 Concepts it's very attractive for
07:29 

07:29 immigrants people want to come to Canada
07:33 

07:33 we have the idea that um people should
07:36 

07:36 come here because we're just and we're
07:38 

07:38 generous versus a business class
07:41 

07:41 approach where you buy your way in uh so
07:44 

07:44 these are ideas I'll talk about more
07:46 

07:46 when we talk about immigration and
07:47 

07:47 Refugee
07:49 

07:49 policy the concept of sustainable
07:52 

07:52 development came into being at this
07:54 

07:54 point and this integrated many different
07:56 

07:56 ideas now 17 SG goals but at that time
08:00 

08:00 we started talking about environmental
08:02 

08:02 and economic and social goals how to
08:05 

08:05 make it a fair world for everyone with
08:07 

08:07 sustainable consumption sevene
08:10 

08:10 Generations into the future making sure
08:12 

08:12 that global trade patterns from the
08:14 

08:14 north to the South and vice versa South
08:17 

08:17 to the north were Fair using appropriate
08:20 

08:20 technology that was solar wind powerered
08:23 

08:23 and using our resources to meet Global
08:27 

08:27 human needs you can see how that comes
08:29 

08:29 that pattern comes right out of me
08:31 

08:31 because it's just natural it's part of
08:33 

08:33 our way of thinking in Canada and that's
08:36 

08:36 what I'm trying to teach you here is
08:38 

08:38 what how this is
08:39 

08:39 evolved the newer concept and issues
08:42 

08:42 from the 1990s also included Greening
08:45 

08:45 the Rio Summit so what does this mean
08:47 

08:47 this was the first un Summit that that
08:49 

08:49 focused on energy I mean so not on
08:53 

08:53 energy on the environment and the reason
08:55 

08:55 it was important was because of the guy
08:57 

08:57 in charge Maurice strong strong he had
08:59 

08:59 the biggest Network in the world I I
09:02 

09:02 heard I saw that his his address book
09:05 

09:05 was like a binder and he he he helped to
09:09 

09:09 craft the agenda 21 agreement he knew
09:12 

09:12 everyone everywhere and that was when
09:15 

09:15 they started talking about the target of
09:18 

09:18 0.7% of G&P for international Aid this
09:22 

09:22 was an idea that came about by Pearson
09:24 

09:24 and the three wise men but this is when
09:26 

09:26 they started actually thinking about
09:28 

09:28 putting it in place Greening Gat and and
09:32 

09:32 guarantees of environmental standards
09:35 

09:35 ratifying it still has not been ratified
09:37 

09:37 but we still talk about it ratify the
09:39 

09:39 law of the sea and developing new
09:41 

09:41 indicators of sustainable development
09:44 

09:44 sustainable was very very
09:46 

09:46 important so here are some pictures of
09:49 

09:49 Central America at the time so while
09:52 

09:52 Canada in the 1990s was developing these
09:55 

09:55 new ideas in the Central America we had
09:58 

09:58 the wars Guatemala Nicaragua Panama
10:03 

10:03 people uh the environment being
10:05 

10:05 destroyed people here you can see drug
10:08 

10:08 use going through the garbages for food
10:10 

10:10 and so on and so extremely distressing
10:13 

10:13 situations and people wanted to help
10:15 

10:15 they really wanted to help people
10:17 

10:17 outside of our borders which is what we
10:19 

10:19 should
10:21 

10:21 do and that's when we started talking
10:23 

10:23 more about North South relations instead
10:26 

10:26 of saying oh they're underdeveloped or
10:28 

10:28 they're less developed or using that
10:31 

10:31 concept of development as if we're so
10:34 

10:34 developed that's wrong instead the idea
10:37 

10:37 was to use the concept of the north
10:39 

10:39 where people do have it seems a higher
10:42 

10:42 GMP now of course you say right away
10:44 

10:44 well Australia New Zealand they have a
10:46 

10:46 high income per capita they're not in
10:48 

10:48 the north but this was a general kind of
10:51 

10:51 a concept that was popular in the 1990s
10:54 

10:54 so the South has it's not it has a lower
10:58 

10:58 G&P has a lower per capita income maybe
11:01 

11:01 it's in the South so the idea then was
11:05 

11:05 that um official development assistance
11:07 

11:07 which we call Oda would rise to
11:10 

11:10 0.7% of GMP by the year
11:15 

11:15 2000 we would also redirect ceda's Aid
11:18 

11:18 Ceda is the international Agency for
11:21 

11:21 Canada that that um that deals with our
11:24 

11:24 Aid and we would direct ceda's aid from
11:27 

11:27 Eastern Europe to the Third world so
11:30 

11:30 instead of spending money on Ukraine and
11:32 

11:32 on Poland it would go to Africa and to
11:36 

11:36 Asia and to South
11:38 

11:38 America I'm dwelling on North South
11:40 

11:40 relations because if you are interested
11:43 

11:43 in in in writing interational Injustice
11:46 

11:46 and in working in development it's still
11:49 

11:49 called development uh then you need to
11:52 

11:52 know some of these phrases if you want
11:53 

11:53 to work internationally if you want to
11:56 

11:56 work for an
11:58 

11:58 NGO so I mentioned before that the this
12:01 

12:01 is an old uh uh picture an old chart and
12:04 

12:04 you can see that the amount of Oda as a
12:07 

12:07 percentage of gross national product for
12:10 

12:10 Canada kept slipping from the Target and
12:13 

12:13 instead of getting up to 0.7% it kept
12:16 

12:16 going down and down and down here more
12:21 

12:21 modern is uh Canada's percentage
12:24 

12:24 compared to other countries so you can
12:26 

12:26 see that um Canada spends 0 . 29%
12:31 

12:31 approximately right now it's
12:33 

12:33 0.27% but these are small amounts that
12:36 

12:36 are different so look at the Danes how
12:38 

12:38 much that they're spending nearly
12:41 

12:41 1% and then the Norwegians are higher
12:45 

12:45 than
12:46 

12:46 0.7% the US is
12:49 

12:49 low um okay so take a look at that and
12:52 

12:52 my
12:54 

12:54 stripes there were many important
12:56 

12:56 reports this was a time when you we we
12:58 

12:58 just did endless reports everyone did
13:01 

13:01 reports reports participated consulted
13:03 

13:03 and so on there were red books there
13:05 

13:05 were white books there were all sorts of
13:07 

13:07 books colored book Black Books and so on
13:11 

13:11 there were reports of special joint
13:13 

13:13 committees and bipartisan committees and
13:16 

13:16 reviewing committees and Canadian
13:17 

13:17 foreign policy committees I sound bored
13:20 

13:20 but it was actually an interesting time
13:22 

13:22 because they were Consulting Civil
13:24 

13:24 Society uh including academics and it
13:26 

13:26 was a time when we were thinking about
13:28 

13:28 can culture was that a way that we could
13:32 

13:32 penetrate other countries like France
13:34 

13:34 who was important to Canadian culture
13:37 

13:37 know that in the 1990s my students could
13:40 

13:40 name easily every single one of these
13:42 

13:42 people without even pausing they knew
13:44 

13:44 who they all were they were all
13:46 

13:46 important and significant Canadian
13:48 

13:48 cultural
13:50 

13:50 icons I want to mention this report uh
13:54 

13:54 because this is the idea of common
13:55 

13:55 security that what I do to increase my
13:58 

13:58 security uh May decrease my adversary
14:01 

14:01 security and we need to think about
14:03 

14:03 common security so as a concept it was
14:06 

14:06 it was very popular in the 1990s and we
14:09 

14:09 gradually also started to think about
14:12 

14:12 using common security principles to
14:14 

14:14 assert sovereignty over Canada's
14:17 

14:17 territory why militarize the Arctic why
14:20 

14:20 Inc decrease Russia's Security in the
14:23 

14:23 United States when we could be more
14:26 

14:26 peaceful my uh one of my thesis
14:28 

14:28 supervisor Janice Stein pictured here
14:32 

14:32 and Maurice archdeacon conducted this
14:34 

14:34 National forum and they solicited ideas
14:38 

14:38 at the time which were moved to indexes
14:40 

14:40 and bring this up because in the early
14:42 

14:42 1990s and the mid 1990s there was no
14:45 

14:45 internet there were no emails everything
14:48 

14:48 was phone calls and letters and
14:51 

14:51 written imagine of course I had my own
14:55 

14:55 consulting company and I bring this up
14:57 

14:57 as a case study why why because I
14:59 

14:59 learned a lot about uh negotiating and
15:03 

15:03 about proposals so my my my uh
15:06 

15:06 Consulting uh agency was called common
15:09 

15:09 Security Consultants and we put together
15:12 

15:12 a proposal for a peacekeeping training
15:14 

15:14 center we worked with uh John Savage and
15:17 

15:17 Alexa mcdonell Brian morone Kim Campbell
15:20 

15:20 Jean Ken and we tried to get everyone to
15:24 

15:24 cooperate on the idea and we were very
15:27 

15:27 successful actually in hindsight
15:30 

15:30 that was our proposal so look you know I
15:33 

15:33 even drew the red Canadian flag can you
15:35 

15:35 imagine but I asked uh Jeffrey Pearson
15:38 

15:38 if we could call it at this point we
15:40 

15:40 needed a name so I asked if we could
15:42 

15:42 call it the Pearson peacekeeping
15:43 

15:43 training center and he said
15:45 

15:45 yes so this was an article by gwy Dyer I
15:48 

15:48 remember I was thrilled to how for him
15:51 

15:51 to write anything that on what we had
15:54 

15:54 done and he's still writing his
15:58 

15:58 columns
16:00 

16:00 I reflect on this because the Lessons
16:03 

16:03 Learned they finally put together a
16:05 

16:05 privatized uh it was privatized it was
16:08 

16:08 called the Lester B Pearson PE Canadian
16:10 

16:10 International peacekeeping Training
16:12 

16:12 Center you could register there and so
16:16 

16:16 on I don't know I have mixed feelings
16:19 

16:19 about
16:20 

16:20 it what I wanted and it leads me to
16:24 

16:24 conclude almost seven years of work by
16:26 

16:26 saying that ideas can go through four
16:28 

16:28 phrase is first they're ignored we were
16:31 

16:31 completely ignored then we were
16:34 

16:34 ridiculed I was ridiculed and then the
16:37 

16:37 idea was accepted as obvious we should
16:39 

16:39 do that and then it was copied there's
16:41 

16:41 there's PE peacekeeping not training
16:43 

16:43 centers all around the world now
16:45 

16:45 although the Canadian one has been
16:48 

16:48 closed let me uh go on to the mid1 1990s
16:52 

16:52 where this was very important budgets
16:54 

16:54 are much more important than you can
16:56 

16:56 imagine and you will learn that the
16:58 

16:58 budget has the big impact on your uh
17:02 

17:02 toolbox so uh Paul Martin was the
17:05 

17:05 Finance Minister under Jean Ken you can
17:07 

17:07 see them here and uh Paul Martin
17:10 

17:10 presenting his budget and this was a cut
17:12 

17:12 cut cut budget he cut defate the
17:16 

17:16 department of Foreign Affairs and
17:17 

17:17 international trade Ceda he
17:20 

17:20 transferred he sold property he reduced
17:24 

17:24 the Department of National Defense he
17:26 

17:26 contracted out but in hindsight this
17:28 

17:28 cutback
17:29 

17:29 at the government level helped when we
17:32 

17:32 hit the 2008 recession but it also
17:35 

17:35 helped in many ways to cut government
17:38 

17:38 spending so we have to be respectful in
17:41 

17:41 hindsight that he made some harsh
17:44 

17:44 decisions and as a result Canada became
17:47 

17:47 wealthier there's was going to be less
17:50 

17:50 Contracting out my common Security
17:51 

17:51 Consultants less money bumping and so
17:55 

17:55 this impact of this budget and the
17:58 

17:58 growing debt
17:59 

17:59 led to a final report I want to mention
18:02 

18:02 called the government of Canada toward a
18:04 

18:04 rapid reaction capability for the UN
18:06 

18:06 report this was a expensive study on the
18:09 

18:09 50th anniversary of the United Nations I
18:11 

18:11 remember we stayed in Monte Bell very
18:14 

18:14 expensive uh Hotel made out of wood
18:18 

18:18 outside of Montreal and we discussed for
18:21 

18:21 days whether there might be a un rapid
18:24 

18:24 reaction capability I was involved
18:27 

18:27 because I had worked on the p in
18:29 

18:29 peacekeeping training center and had
18:30 

18:30 written a lot on peacekeeping training
18:33 

18:33 so at that time the government wanted uh
18:35 

18:35 Vanguard forces joint planning and
18:38 

18:38 training we rejected the idea of a
18:41 

18:41 volunteer un force it would be one with
18:45 

18:45 a combination of volunteers and
18:47 

18:47 professional Soldiers the main problem
18:51 

18:51 was that the proposal was rejected by
18:53 

18:53 the United States behind the scene and
18:55 

18:55 the UN couldn't it just didn't have the
18:58 

18:58 money with without the US um endorsing
19:02 

19:02 it so this leads me to a small success
19:06 

19:06 during the 1990s the Pearson Center uh
19:08 

19:08 failed and so did the rapid reaction
19:10 

19:10 capability idea it failed the landmines
19:14 

19:14 concept which was a more minor concept
19:16 

19:16 actually became very very successful so
19:19 

19:19 let's look at that the landmines treaty
19:22 

19:22 was proposed in 1997 and it some people
19:25 

19:25 will call it the Ottawa process because
19:27 

19:27 some of the meetings were in Ottawa
19:29 

19:29 Canada's
19:31 

19:31 capital this was a very successful
19:33 

19:33 Coalition between the anti- landmine
19:36 

19:36 Coalition of NOS Civil Society Nos and
19:41 

19:41 those that were in government and Canada
19:44 

19:44 really called for a unilateral ban this
19:47 

19:47 is interesting because we didn't hope
19:49 

19:49 for a negotiated multilateral ban we
19:52 

19:52 just said we're going to have a
19:53 

19:53 unilateral ban among the countries that
19:54 

19:54 export them and there won't be the
19:57 

19:57 further manufacturer of anti-personnel
19:60 

19:60 landmines so I put a picture of a
20:02 

20:02 landmine there they're very small
20:04 

20:04 sometimes they look like airplanes or
20:06 

20:06 drones they can be plastic or they can
20:08 

20:08 be metal they're not huge landmines like
20:11 

20:11 anti-tank landmines but the idea was to
20:15 

20:15 ban them because they killed and maimed
20:18 

20:18 civilians Canada obtained a moratorium
20:21 

20:21 no more of them were allowed to be
20:23 

20:23 produced among the signatory countries
20:25 

20:25 on the production the export and the use
20:28 

20:28 of anti personel landmines my friend uh
20:31 

20:31 uh Earl worked very hard on this a
20:33 

20:33 diplomat and then he moved into cluster
20:35 

20:35 mines and he was able to get that to be
20:37 

20:37 banned as
20:39 

20:39 well so landmines treaty was a landmark
20:42 

20:42 um among diplomats and uh civil society
20:45 

20:45 and NOS the Minister of Foreign Affairs
20:48 

20:48 pictured there Lloyd axworthy uh with
20:51 

20:51 Jean Ken app pling behind him and Kofi
20:54 

20:54 Anan the UN Secretary General so that's
20:57 

20:57 Lloyd axworthy they uh were very pleased
20:60 

20:60 with this which was a a unilateral move
21:03 

21:03 so keep that in mind when you're
21:05 

21:05 thinking your examples of unilateral
21:07 

21:07 measures that have few costs this was
21:10 

21:10 just a couple of conferences one in Oslo
21:13 

21:13 and one in in Ottawa and the countries
21:15 

21:15 came back sure the United States and
21:18 

21:18 Russia and the big powers and South
21:20 

21:20 Korea did not sign the treaty but Japan
21:23 

21:23 and many middle Powers did so now it's
21:25 

21:25 what's called an informal regime it's an
21:28 

21:28 informal regime where countries
21:30 

21:30 informally and formally agree not to
21:33 

21:33 manufacture anti- uh
21:37 

21:37 landmines this leads me to talk about
21:39 

21:39 the international criminal court which
21:41 

21:41 has to interest you if you want to go
21:43 

21:43 into law by the way take a look under my
21:45 

21:45 coffee break slides I think I called it
21:48 

21:48 I need a break slides and there is a a
21:51 

21:51 PowerPoint production on how to get into
21:54 

21:54 law school if you want to get into law
21:57 

21:57 school um m one of my first students
21:60 

21:60 helped to set up the international
22:02 

22:02 criminal court she was actually worked
22:05 

22:05 for the Ambassador K on setting up the
22:08 

22:08 international criminal court it started
22:11 

22:11 with this first idea of an international
22:13 

22:13 criminal Tribunal for the former
22:15 

22:15 Yugoslavia see how you build up your
22:18 

22:18 ideas then they did one for Rwanda of
22:20 

22:20 course they got criticized for for doing
22:22 

22:22 one for Rwanda and not for doing one for
22:25 

22:25 Nicaragua or for a US hegemonic based
22:29 

22:29 area the principal prosecutor was a
22:32 

22:32 Canadian and her name is Madame Justice
22:35 

22:35 Louise abour if you ever want to look at
22:38 

22:38 a CV that is extremely impressive by a
22:42 

22:42 lawyer you take a look at her and and
22:44 

22:44 and follow in her footsteps learn and do
22:47 

22:47 what she did because you could also
22:49 

22:49 become incredibly important and
22:52 

22:52 Powerful so the international criminal
22:54 

22:54 court was formerly established after 60
22:57 

22:57 countries ratified the Rome statute of
22:60 

22:60 the
23:01 

23:01 ICC 60 countries but it is extremely
23:05 

23:05 important and that led to Canada being
23:09 

23:09 seen as more important we were working
23:11 

23:11 on peacekeeping we were working on
23:13 

23:13 development Aid and then we were voted
23:16 

23:16 on and we became a member of the UN
23:18 

23:18 Security Council in
23:20 

23:20 1999 I remember the Ambassador who was
23:22 

23:22 in charge Robert Fowler he had worked on
23:25 

23:25 the peacekeeping training center and so
23:27 

23:27 he was allowed to chair just like
23:30 

23:30 Pearson had chaired the UN Security
23:32 

23:32 Council so we serve for a two-year term
23:35 

23:35 on that until the end of December 2000
23:38 

23:38 and among our many responsibilities was
23:41 

23:41 to do sanctions against Angola but we
23:43 

23:43 actually didn't do a lot we didn't do a
23:46 

23:46 lot but still it was it it gave us an
23:49 

23:49 insight into what was happening
23:52 

23:52 internationally so let's think about a
23:54 

23:54 conceptual framework that actually
23:56 

23:56 describes the ketchen government's
23:57 

23:57 foreign policymaking style a simple idea
24:01 

24:01 is the concept of multilateralism this
24:03 

24:03 is the practice of coordinating National
24:06 

24:06 policies in groups of three or more
24:09 

24:09 States so it's not two and it's not one
24:12 

24:12 it's three or more and these can be ad
24:15 

24:15 hoc or they can be by means of
24:18 

24:18 Institutions that's the simple concept
24:20 

24:20 of
24:21 

24:21 multilateralism and I want to now talk
24:24 

24:24 about multilateralism a bit more because
24:26 

24:26 Canada has its own kind of ver of
24:28 

24:28 multilateralism which is used to
24:30 

24:30 describe the cretan government's foreign
24:33 

24:33 policym style this is where a country
24:37 

24:37 working in solidarity with coalitions of
24:41 

24:41 States like the Commonwealth or
24:44 

24:44 NATO coalitions of associations like La
24:48 

24:48 Fran and international institutions like
24:51 

24:51 the United Nations and NATO to achieve
24:54 

24:54 Canadian foreign policy objectives so
24:57 

24:57 that can
24:59 

24:59 under the ketchen government was a
25:00 

25:00 member of more International
25:02 

25:02 organizations than any country in the
25:05 

25:05 world we were a member of
25:09 

25:09 everything and this kind of friendliness
25:12 

25:12 was was very popular uh it was described
25:16 

25:16 the cran government Style I want to
25:19 

25:19 bring up another concept which was
25:21 

25:21 called di directed multilateralism and
25:24 

25:24 this was where we argued that we should
25:28 

25:28 direct our foreign policy to the
25:31 

25:31 institutions like NATO that are best
25:33 

25:33 suited to Canadian requirements NORAD
25:36 

25:36 and NAFTA we should give priority to
25:39 

25:39 those institutions so you see how
25:41 

25:41 they're starting to dilute it and it is
25:44 

25:44 interesting when you dilute it it means
25:47 

25:47 you have to leave people and
25:48 

25:48 institutions by the wayside that you're
25:50 

25:50 not going to pay as much attention
25:55 

25:55 to I'm going to end with the team Canada
25:57 

25:57 approach because in the end this is uh
26:00 

26:00 Jean kin was a big player of hockey he
26:02 

26:02 really likes hockey uh and so this
26:05 

26:05 concept was used to describe what he did
26:07 

26:07 because he took Team Canada to China
26:11 

26:11 three times this is a coalition of
26:14 

26:14 leaders from the provinces the premieres
26:17 

26:17 and the federal government including
26:18 

26:18 Quebec and the private sector so they
26:21 

26:21 they tried to um encourage more and more
26:25 

26:25 interaction with
26:26 

26:26 China team Canada approach should we
26:29 

26:29 have that again with
26:30 

26:30 China I'm starting to ask you these
26:32 

26:32 questions because at the time when Jean
26:35 

26:35 cran was prime minister Canada did
26:38 

26:38 really reach out to many many countries
26:40 

26:40 we didn't try to dilute our
26:42 

26:42 multilateralism we didn't say oh well
26:45 

26:45 well we're not going to be friends with
26:46 

26:46 the Chinese we're not going to be
26:48 

26:48 friends with the Russians we're we're
26:50 

26:50 going to keep our friends and allies to
26:52 

26:52 a small group no no it was the approach
26:54 

26:54 was very much let's try to approach
26:57 

26:57 South Korea let's go to Japan let's
27:00 

27:00 let's try to visit uh with everyone that
27:03 

27:03 we can and so Jean cran was a
27:06 

27:06 interesting prime minister in hindsight
27:08 

27:08 thank you for listening
