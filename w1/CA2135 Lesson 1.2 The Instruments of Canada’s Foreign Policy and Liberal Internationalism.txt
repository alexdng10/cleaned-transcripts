00:01 welcome to lesson one on the instruments
00:05 

00:05 of Canada's foreign policy we will learn
00:09 

00:09 about what's called liberal or
00:12 

00:12 pearsonian internationalism
00:15 

00:15 this is the first lecture it gives you
00:18 

00:18 an idea of the pacing
00:20 

00:20 of the focus
00:23 

00:23 you can see the captions do not
00:26 

00:26 correctly translate what I am saying
00:30 

00:30 PowerPoints captions are very poor and
00:34 

00:34 it would take me too much time to fix
00:37 

00:37 the captions
00:39 

00:39 instead we will use YouTube
00:43 

00:43 I will export this to YouTube channel
00:46 

00:46 and you can watch it in English or any
00:49 

00:49 language that you like YouTube is
00:52 

00:52 responsible for the correct caption I am
00:57 

00:57 not
00:58 

00:58 what I say and what I show you on the
01:01 

01:01 PowerPoint is what will be tested not
01:05 

01:05 the incorrect captions below
01:08 

01:08 let's launch into our first mainly
01:12 

01:12 historical lecture
01:17 

01:17 we're going to begin with the golden age
01:20 

01:20 of Canadian diplomacy so we're going
01:22 

01:22 back to the 1940s and the 1950s and the
01:26 

01:26 reason for that is because of the
01:28 

01:28 influence of Michael Pearson or Lester
01:31 

01:31 Pearson that was his official name Mike
01:33 

01:33 Pearson and he was the under Secretary
01:36 

01:36 of State for external Affairs we used to
01:39 

01:39 call the Department of Foreign Affairs
01:41 

01:41 the department of global Affairs and
01:43 

01:43 before that was the department of
01:45 

01:45 external Affairs so I'm just mentioning
01:47 

01:47 that because he was the most senior
01:49 

01:49 Diplomat for a very long time and then
01:52 

01:52 he became the leader the official leader
01:54 

01:54 of the opposition so he headed the
01:56 

01:56 liberal party for many years and then
01:59 

01:59 finally he was elected prime minister in
02:02 

02:02 1963 right after the Cuban Missile
02:05 

02:05 Crisis until 1968. so you can see he
02:08 

02:08 wrote three volumes of Memoirs which are
02:10 

02:10 all very interesting and then you can
02:12 

02:12 see some pictures there of him including
02:15 

02:15 a statue
02:17 

02:17 so the golden age is so important that
02:19 

02:19 that statue is featured in front of the
02:21 

02:21 parliament in Ottawa and there are so
02:24 

02:24 many Canadian diplomats that were hailed
02:26 

02:26 around the world of course they were all
02:28 

02:28 men but at that time men went to work in
02:31 

02:31 the 1940s and 50s and women there were
02:34 

02:34 no women diplomats which is extremely
02:36 

02:36 interesting in hindsight so who were the
02:39 

02:39 male diplomats that were so famous there
02:41 

02:41 were many of them Ascot Reed who wrote
02:45 

02:45 quite a few books later John Holmes
02:47 

02:47 wrote many books George ignati if I'm
02:49 

02:49 going to show you a book Norman
02:50 

02:50 Robertson was quiet but he was very
02:52 

02:52 senior Arnold Heaney whom I'll show you
02:55 

02:55 a minute a picture of Odie Skelton Hume
02:57 

02:57 wrong and basil Robinson whom I had the
02:60 

02:60 honor of interviewing many years ago
03:04 

03:04 so here's a picture of Lester Pearson at
03:08 

03:08 the on wearing the bow tie which he
03:10 

03:11 often wore and then in the middle was
03:13 

03:13 the secretary uh uh I'm sorry what am I
03:16 

03:16 saying Anthony Eden from the United
03:19 

03:19 Kingdom and Dean Atchison on the right
03:22 

03:22 so he was the Secretary of State for the
03:25 

03:25 United States so this is a very senior
03:28 

03:28 meeting
03:31 

03:31 here are some more pictures you can see
03:33 

03:33 Lester Pearson laughing up at the top
03:36 

03:36 back row and you can see in the middle
03:39 

03:39 various people including John Foster
03:42 

03:42 duddles Dulles in the middle CD Howe
03:45 

03:45 very famous diplomats
03:48 

03:48 is another picture so you can see you're
03:50 

03:50 getting the idea of Pearson enjoyed
03:52 

03:52 himself he talked about baseball he was
03:55 

03:55 a happy guy everyone enjoyed being with
03:57 

03:57 him there's Dwight Eisenhower the Prime
03:60 

03:60 Minister and then the prime minister of
04:02 

04:02 Canada Louis San wrong
04:04 

04:04 before Stephen Baker
04:07 

04:07 then one final picture here of Arnold
04:10 

04:10 Heaney
04:12 

04:12 who was the under Secretary of State
04:13 

04:13 when he was just coming out there of
04:16 

04:16 parliament in 1949 after the war and
04:19 

04:19 Pearson
04:21 

04:21 the Golden Age and it led finally to uh
04:25 

04:25 Pearson at the United Nations getting
04:28 

04:28 the Nobel Peace Prize which I'm going to
04:30 

04:30 talk to you about
04:33 

04:33 his uh his eye again a 1952 the
04:38 

04:38 president of the um Security Council the
04:40 

04:41 rotating U.N security Council
04:44 

04:44 so why did the Golden Age end there are
04:46 

04:46 a lot of reasons there was of course uh
04:49 

04:49 the rise of the superpower rivalry in
04:51 

04:51 the beginning of the Cold War but there
04:54 

04:54 was also the rise of other middle powers
04:56 

04:56 like Canada so other countries like
04:58 

04:58 Brazil and India and Mexico came to the
05:01 

05:01 foreign Canada fell down in comparison
05:03 

05:03 to them we also had the Marshall Plan
05:06 

05:06 maybe we'll have a Marshall Plan 2.0 for
05:09 

05:09 Ukraine I've just written an article on
05:11 

05:11 that in the hill times but it's the idea
05:14 

05:14 that we would re-impose the Marshall
05:16 

05:16 Plan and have one for Ukraine so why did
05:20 

05:20 it succeed billions of dollars went into
05:23 

05:23 France and Germany and into the other
05:26 

05:26 smaller powers
05:27 

05:27 there was also less reliance
05:30 

05:30 on International institutions like the
05:33 

05:33 UN as there is today
05:35 

05:35 who was famous I mentioned some of them
05:38 

05:38 but another famous Diplomat was George
05:40 

05:40 ignati of pictured here who was a very
05:43 

05:43 much into peace his son Michael Ignatius
05:46 

05:46 ran for prime minister so George was
05:49 

05:49 fluently bilingual in Russian and in
05:51 

05:51 English
05:52 

05:52 there's Pearson again bowtie
05:55 

05:55 so what were the main accomplishments
05:57 

05:57 there in hindsight probably the
05:60 

05:60 establishment of NATO at that time with
06:02 

06:02 12 members and the imposition of the
06:05 

06:05 Canadian Article 2 which asked for
06:07 

06:07 economic and social collaboration and
06:10 

06:10 cooperation
06:11 

06:11 so they really emphasized article two
06:14 

06:14 John Foster Dulles did not want to
06:16 

06:17 insert it into the Washington treaty but
06:20 

06:20 in pressure by the Canadian diplomats
06:22 

06:22 who were so good at what they did
06:23 

06:23 brought that in now in hindsight it's
06:26 

06:26 Article 5 which I've talked to you about
06:28 

06:28 that is so important we also had under
06:31 

06:31 in the Golden Age the establishment of
06:34 

06:34 U.N peacekeeping forces so I'm going to
06:36 

06:36 talk to you more about that the blue
06:37 

06:37 helmets
06:40 

06:40 we need to return back to the Suez
06:43 

06:43 Crisis and it seems people keep saying
06:45 

06:45 right now oh the Ukraine crisis and the
06:47 

06:47 Korea crisis could we have a crisis two
06:50 

06:50 crises could we have a Taiwan Straits
06:52 

06:52 crisis so what they're referring back to
06:55 

06:55 is two crises way back in 1956. one was
06:59 

06:59 over the Suez Canal the Suez Canal
07:01 

07:02 shaped shapes and controls the flow of
07:05 

07:05 oil so it shortens the X the export of
07:09 

07:09 oil from the Middle East to Europe and
07:12 

07:12 to the United States the problem was
07:15 

07:15 that Egypt planned to build a huge Dam
07:18 

07:18 called the Aswan Dam it's now built and
07:21 

07:21 the United States and the United Kingdom
07:23 

07:23 suddenly withdrew their financing of the
07:25 

07:25 of the dam so this made the leader of
07:29 

07:29 Egypt very very angry and so he decided
07:32 

07:32 to nationalize that the dam which was
07:35 

07:35 too risky
07:37 

07:37 so here's the Suez Canal you can see it
07:41 

07:41 is going between the Red Sea where is my
07:45 

07:45 pan uh here we are and uh
07:48 

07:48 going into the Mediterranean Sea
07:51 

07:51 to get out to Europe
07:54 

07:54 and this is a picture of it from from
07:56 

07:56 the
07:57 

07:57 from
07:59 

07:59 not space but fairly High
08:03 

08:03 the Suez Crisis happened at the same
08:06 

08:06 time as the Union of Soviet Socialist
08:08 

08:08 republics the former Russia now the
08:11 

08:11 Russian Federation invaded Hungary and
08:15 

08:15 they invaded in 1956 with pretty well no
08:18 

08:18 notice just like this invasion of
08:19 

08:19 Ukraine crisis
08:21 

08:21 so it came as a complete surprise you
08:24 

08:24 can see that President Eisenhower and
08:27 

08:27 the U.S Secretary of State whom I just
08:28 

08:29 showed you John Foster Dulles in the
08:31 

08:31 state department were taken by surprise
08:33 

08:33 they decided uh what to do well they did
08:38 

08:38 not realize that the French and the
08:41 

08:41 Israelis and the United Kingdom were
08:43 

08:43 secretly meeting to discuss a detailed
08:46 

08:46 timetable without telling their NATO
08:49 

08:49 allies of what they plan to do they plan
08:52 

08:52 to to invade
08:54 

08:54 so Israeli forces crossed the canal and
08:58 

08:58 they attacked Egypt on October 29 1956.
09:03 

09:03 so this came as a complete surprise to
09:04 

09:04 everyone there were negotiations that
09:06 

09:06 the U.N meanwhile these great Powers
09:09 

09:09 were negotiating or were secretly
09:11 

09:11 planning to attack Egypt
09:15 

09:15 there's a picture of the canal again and
09:18 

09:18 some pictures from the 1950s of the
09:22 

09:22 different coalitions and so on
09:26 

09:26 the U.S officials and the Canadian
09:28 

09:28 officials recognize that the Israeli
09:30 

09:30 attack had a lot of implications it
09:32 

09:32 wasn't just Israeli but it was also nine
09:34 

09:34 Kingdom in France it could turn the Arab
09:36 

09:36 world against the West
09:39 

09:39 it would Aid the USSR in terms of
09:42 

09:42 propaganda it would divide NATO and it
09:45 

09:45 would undermine the other nations so
09:48 

09:48 they were very shocked that even though
09:50 

09:50 they were having these negotiations that
09:52 

09:52 the United Nations the United Kingdom
09:54 

09:54 France and Israel had lied about their
09:57 

09:57 intentions
09:58 

09:58 what to do Pearson I put a picture of
10:01 

10:01 him thinking thinking thinking thinking
10:02 

10:02 he can see that there's four huge
10:05 

10:05 shifting things to remember here first
10:07 

10:07 of all cooperation
10:10 

10:10 among among the United Kingdom and
10:13 

10:13 France Canada's mother countries so the
10:16 

10:16 United Kingdom and France were were our
10:18 

10:18 mother countries then and cooperation
10:21 

10:21 with the United States our closest
10:22 

10:22 neighbor
10:24 

10:24 and a super flower was threatened so
10:27 

10:27 he's thinking about the shifting
10:28 

10:28 superpower and middle power
10:31 

10:31 alliances and he's concerned obviously
10:34 

10:34 he's worried NATO can fall apart he had
10:36 

10:36 tried to put NATO together
10:38 

10:38 the United Nations which he worked on
10:40 

10:40 for so long was also being undermined
10:42 

10:42 and threatened by this the Commonwealth
10:45 

10:45 which Canada was a part of and continues
10:47 

10:47 to be a part of the English-speaking
10:49 

10:49 world ruled at that time by the queen
10:52 

10:52 Queen Elizabeth this could also be
10:55 

10:55 divided and to add to it add to the
10:58 

10:58 crisis the USSR attack USSR attack on
11:02 

11:02 Hungary was a problem so in 1956 it
11:05 

11:05 looked as if the West Was going to
11:08 

11:08 Simply allow the USSR to use Force to
11:12 

11:12 settle disputes just like today where
11:14 

11:14 the West has Allied strongly against the
11:18 

11:18 Russian Federation and even in Europe
11:20 

11:20 despite gas shortages and despite
11:22 

11:22 problems
11:23 

11:23 the West is Allied so Pearson was
11:26 

11:26 idealistic he was What's called the
11:29 

11:29 liberal internationalist
11:31 

11:31 and that's why Canadians are seen as
11:33 

11:33 different from Americans because of our
11:35 

11:35 liberal internationalism I'm going to
11:37 

11:37 explain this in more detail because you
11:39 

11:39 are the inheritors of that philosophy
11:43 

11:43 which competes against the USSR idea of
11:48 

11:48 invasion and the Russian idea of
11:49 

11:50 invasion and the use of Armed Force
11:53 

11:53 ideas were lauded Pearson received the
11:57 

11:57 Nobel Peace Prize in 1958 actually I've
12:01 

12:01 got to correct that because because he
12:04 

12:04 he for his behavior in 1957 but he got
12:06 

12:06 it in 1958 and he helped establish the
12:09 

12:09 United Nations emergency Force the
12:12 

12:12 general who helped him was Elm Burns he
12:15 

12:15 was a Canadian General and he was in
12:18 

12:18 charge of UNIF one
12:20 

12:20 so there's Dad camera schools he was
12:23 

12:23 killed later he was a great poet as well
12:27 

12:27 so there you can see Dad camera School
12:29 

12:29 talking to Lester Pearson about what to
12:33 

12:33 do and there's Pearson holding his Nobel
12:35 

12:35 Peace Prize
12:37 

12:37 metal
12:40 

12:40 the U.S to States Department was
12:42 

12:42 involved behind the scenes and this is
12:44 

12:44 according to different accounts by
12:46 

12:46 Pearson and the U.S ambassador to the
12:48 

12:48 United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge Lodge
12:52 

12:52 had the draft from the United States
12:54 

12:54 state department of the idea of a
12:56 

12:56 Pearson peace of a peacekeeping force
12:59 

12:59 and he
13:00 

13:00 realized that Pearson could possibly put
13:04 

13:04 it out on the U.N General Assembly stage
13:07 

13:07 so he had the draft he saw Pearson he
13:11 

13:11 said the U.S would be very gratified if
13:13 

13:13 Canada would sponsor the resolution
13:15 

13:15 Pearson speedily read it quickly made up
13:18 

13:18 his mind saw the hidden meanings and
13:20 

13:20 hooks and he sponsored it in the U.N
13:22 

13:22 General Assembly so according to Henry
13:24 

13:24 Cabot Lodge I have never seen a man in a
13:28 

13:28 forum pick up and comprehend a
13:29 

13:29 complicated thing of far-reaching
13:32 

13:32 implications and then get recognized and
13:34 

13:34 get the floor and propose it immediately
13:37 

13:38 so here I ask you did he deserve the
13:42 

13:42 prize yes he put in place an idea it had
13:45 

13:45 been circulating for a long time since
13:47 

13:47 the 1940s but he put it in place an idea
13:51 

13:51 whose time had come
13:54 

13:54 and that's what we're going to be
13:55 

13:55 talking about today is the ideas that
13:57 

13:57 you have in your toolbox because you may
14:01 

14:01 get the opportunity at some point to put
14:04 

14:04 your idea in place in the idea you have
14:07 

14:07 in your toolbox
14:09 

14:09 you may get the Pierce you may get the
14:11 

14:11 Nobel Peace Prize you might become Prime
14:14 

14:14 Minister
14:15 

14:15 imagine that
14:17 

14:17 so here you can see Lester Pearson with
14:20 

14:20 a Trudeau and uh
14:24 

14:24 Diplomat and a politician greatly
14:26 

14:26 admired all around the world
14:28 

14:28 there are more books I mean imagine
14:31 

14:31 more books so many books written on you
14:35 

14:35 oh let's talk about some other lessons
14:37 

14:37 that Pearson didn't really want to talk
14:39 

14:39 about as much but these are lessons from
14:42 

14:42 the Vietnam War from the 1960s Canada
14:45 

14:45 was involved in into China that was the
14:48 

14:48 old name for Vietnam way back since the
14:51 

14:51 1950s and the Geneva conference but
14:54 

14:54 those International commissions just did
14:56 

14:56 not work so Canadian opposition to the
14:59 

14:59 War Began to rise in 1960s in the 1960s
15:03 

15:03 but in 1965 due to the U.S bombing of
15:08 

15:08 the Vietcong which was the group in
15:10 

15:10 Vietnam that was fighting and the U.S
15:12 

15:12 bombing of North Vietnam which was
15:15 

15:15 terrible so Pearson's famous speech at
15:18 

15:18 that time is called his Temple
15:20 

15:20 University speech and it departed from
15:23 

15:23 his usual policy of quiet diplomacy you
15:26 

15:26 saw how he worked behind the scenes at
15:28 

15:28 the U.N and at NATO and negotiated
15:30 

15:30 quietly he was an advocate of quiet
15:34 

15:34 diplomacy
15:37 

15:37 so here's a picture this famous picture
15:39 

15:39 of an absolute assassin killing which
15:43 

15:43 was in the newspapers
15:46 

15:46 and there's a movie there's many movies
15:49 

15:49 you can watch on the Vietnam War that's
15:51 

15:51 from a movie
15:54 

15:54 so Kirsten's speech in the middle of the
15:56 

15:56 Vietnam War was quite surprising
15:59 

15:59 actually he did it in the president's
16:01 

16:01 own backyard and he was very critical he
16:05 

16:05 said that there should be a pause in the
16:07 

16:07 bombing in the interests of peace and
16:09 

16:09 negotiations and a ceasefire so Canada's
16:13 

16:13 ambassador to the United States Charles
16:15 

16:15 Ritchie
16:17 

16:17 who wrote many books later was summoned
16:19 

16:20 to an angry meeting with the U.S
16:22 

16:22 president Lyndon Johnson and an advisor
16:25 

16:25 who was also quite famous with George
16:28 

16:28 Bundy at count David
16:32 

16:32 there the U.S president bellowed at the
16:34 

16:34 Canadian Prime Minister the Ambassador
16:37 

16:37 Charles Ritchie engaged in a spot a
16:40 

16:40 fighting argument and back at the
16:43 

16:43 cottage Richie wrote that he saw Johnson
16:45 

16:45 grab Pearson by the shirt
16:47 

16:47 which is quite offensive really I mean
16:50 

16:50 can you imagine if Joe Biden we can't
16:53 

16:53 even imagine this but we anyway Richie
16:56 

16:56 phoned him and congratulated him and
16:58 

16:58 suggested maybe what shall we do Pearson
17:01 

17:01 was calm but Richie got the feeling he
17:04 

17:04 was quite shaken I'm sure he was
17:07 

17:07 so what did he decide to do he chose to
17:10 

17:10 defuse the matter with a conciliatory
17:12 

17:12 letter so we're going to be talking in
17:15 

17:15 your toolbox about using letters to
17:18 

17:18 diplomats and to embassies and we're
17:20 

17:20 going to talk about letters but this is
17:22 

17:22 a classic letter here where Pearson
17:25 

17:25 wrote that his proposal had been
17:28 

17:28 because of Canada being a political
17:30 

17:30 democracy and so on so it was
17:33 

17:33 conciliatory
17:34 

17:34 peaceful
17:37 

17:37 that leads me to talk about the
17:39 

17:39 theoretical framework of liberal
17:41 

17:41 internationalism so what are its main
17:43 

17:43 tenets and its main diplomats are John
17:46 

17:46 Holmes and many of the people from the
17:48 

17:48 Golden Age
17:50 

17:50 the first argument or first tenant is
17:53 

17:53 that Canada should act as a middle power
17:55 

17:55 that means that we should try to
17:58 

17:58 negotiate for the superpowers we should
18:01 

18:01 try to compromise on resolutions could
18:03 

18:03 be conciliatory we should try to reduce
18:06 

18:06 tensions and Lobby people around the
18:09 

18:09 world see Canada as an interlocutor
18:12 

18:12 because of our vast geography between
18:14 

18:14 the United States and Russia they see us
18:17 

18:17 as being peaceful we're always saying
18:20 

18:20 sorry sorry some people call this humane
18:23 

18:23 internationalism
18:25 

18:25 [Music]
18:28 

18:28 there you can see a book by John Holmes
18:30 

18:30 I remember listening to him he would
18:33 

18:33 talk out his speeches in the Canadian
18:35 

18:35 Institute for international Affairs and
18:36 

18:36 I would just listen to him speaking out
18:38 

18:38 his books it was amazing these men could
18:41 

18:41 write really well
18:45 

18:45 so there's some more books by Jack
18:47 

18:47 Brownstein
18:49 

18:49 I do that was important to Liberal
18:51 

18:51 internationalism was functionalism it
18:54 

18:54 conflicts in a way with the idea of
18:55 

18:55 Canada's middle power because here it
18:58 

18:58 says
18:59 

18:59 that
19:00 

19:00 um
19:02 

19:02 we can restrict membership in
19:04 

19:04 institutions to those who are interested
19:06 

19:06 so for example on the law of C we should
19:09 

19:09 have negotiations just among those
19:10 

19:11 countries that have a lot of C
19:14 

19:14 if we have a lot of resources on
19:16 

19:16 something then those countries should
19:17 

19:17 negotiate so you can see that conflicts
19:20 

19:20 with the concept of sovereign equality
19:22 

19:22 at the United Nations and equal
19:24 

19:24 representation but functionalism was
19:26 

19:26 popular because people thought that's
19:29 

19:29 how we can avert great power hegemony we
19:32 

19:32 will argue for functionalism
19:34 

19:34 it does conflict with middle Parliament
19:36 

19:36 ship though
19:44 

19:44 the next important idea was that Canada
19:47 

19:47 should play a mediatory role that means
19:50 

19:50 rather than being an apologist for the
19:52 

19:52 United States or being a puppet or a
19:54 

19:54 Lackey Canadians and diplomats should
19:57 

19:57 strive to obtain compromises and
19:59 

19:59 solutions to world problems which is why
20:01 

20:01 we're going to be doing our toolbox
20:02 

20:02 today we're going to be trying to think
20:05 

20:05 about how we can mediate a gradual
20:07 

20:07 Improvement in World Order and bring
20:10 

20:10 about change through mediation and
20:12 

20:12 compromise
20:13 

20:13 so there you can see those pictures I
20:15 

20:15 showed you before Pearson laughing
20:17 

20:17 amongst all these men but now in a new
20:20 

20:20 world that we're in maybe you can think
20:22 

20:22 in your toolbox of new ways to promote
20:25 

20:25 compromise and to promote Solutions
20:28 

20:28 getting to your toolbox which is so
20:31 

20:31 important it's important to be what's
20:33 

20:33 called a participatory internationalist
20:36 

20:36 a person who wants to strengthen world
20:38 

20:38 peace that is active in accepting
20:42 

20:42 International responsibilities and
20:43 

20:43 contributing to International
20:44 

20:44 organizations so that was also that idea
20:48 

20:48 of internationalism was very popular
20:50 

20:50 during the golden age but also still
20:53 

20:53 it's a liberal internationalist concept
20:57 

20:57 the concept of collective security is
20:59 

20:59 opposed to reverses a collective defense
21:02 

21:02 so collective security is the idea of
21:07 

21:07 creating and maintaining organizations
21:09 

21:09 to preserve peace among the members so
21:12 

21:12 it's the United Nations NATO among the
21:15 

21:15 members Collective defense is a pact
21:18 

21:18 among the members to defend against an
21:22 

21:22 outsider so NATO is also a collective
21:25 

21:25 defense organization
21:29 

21:29 and finally the concepts of flexibility
21:32 

21:32 twinned with quiet diplomacy these are
21:35 

21:35 the ideas that we should be flexible we
21:38 

21:38 should react we should not use loud
21:41 

21:41 megaphone diplomacy we should use behind
21:44 

21:44 the scenes techniques of persuasion we
21:47 

21:47 should never criticize on another
21:49 

21:49 country's soil like Pearson did during
21:52 

21:52 the Temple University speech we should
21:54 

21:54 try to never publicly criticize
21:56 

21:56 countries and leaders we should
21:58 

21:58 criticize behind the scenes
22:01 

22:01 so there's some Final Shots you can see
22:04 

22:04 John English came to my class once many
22:06 

22:06 years ago and gave a lecture he wrote a
22:09 

22:09 number of volumes on the Pearson years
22:13 

22:13 if you could make these same guidelines
22:15 

22:15 that Pearson did and you could play this
22:17 

22:17 kind of a role on the world stage you
22:21 

22:21 can use these same Concepts and ideas in
22:24 

22:24 new wording or the same wording and you
22:27 

22:27 can forge out there in your own boat
22:29 

22:29 with the Canadian flag and you can try
22:32 

22:32 to change the world
22:36 

22:36 so these principles do have their roots
22:39 

22:39 in Liberal ideology small algebra not
22:42 

22:42 the party liberal but the small L
22:44 

22:44 liberal ideology and it's a belief in
22:47 

22:47 equality and freedom and tolerance among
22:49 

22:50 individuals and among nations it's this
22:53 

22:53 faith in humankind's power to solve our
22:56 

22:56 problems somehow through mediation and
22:58 

22:58 compromise not through war and violence
23:00 

23:00 and armed conflict it's a belief that we
23:04 

23:04 are progressing that the world will
23:06 

23:06 become better the humankind is not
23:09 

23:09 perfect now but will become perfect
23:11 

23:11 later and could gradually reform
23:14 

23:14 International institutions to become
23:16 

23:16 more peaceful and finally it's an appeal
23:19 

23:19 to human rationality and not to
23:22 

23:22 selfishness to enlightened self-interest
23:25 

23:25 that's what it appeals to so as to
23:27 

23:27 obtain the harmony of Interest instead
23:30 

23:30 of constant War
23:34 

23:34 some final books there are many many
23:36 

23:36 books have been written by Canadians and
23:38 

23:38 that's why worldwide if you go to the
23:40 

23:40 United States and you speak to diplomats
23:42 

23:42 they'll nod and look at you and think
23:43 

23:44 that you have inherited this kind of
23:45 

23:45 thinking pattern
23:48 

23:48 are these principles useful are they
23:50 

23:50 relevant anymore why why or why not and
23:53 

23:53 would you recommend some alternative
23:55 

23:55 guidelines we'll keep thinking about
23:56 

23:56 that as we move through today's slides
23:58 

23:58 because you're going to be making your
24:01 

24:01 own toolbox thanks for listening
