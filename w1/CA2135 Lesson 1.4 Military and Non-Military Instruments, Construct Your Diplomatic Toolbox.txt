00:01 welcome students to the final part uh
00:04 

00:04 the fourth part of lesson one this is on
00:06 

00:06 Military instruments and non-military
00:09 

00:09 instruments so we will review different
00:11 

00:11 types of techniques and instruments that
00:14 

00:14 governments especially Canada use
00:20 

00:20 the instruments of foreign policy are
00:22 

00:22 generally divided into military and
00:24 

00:24 non-military instruments I'm going to
00:27 

00:27 divide them that way and also talk about
00:30 

00:30 the benefits of using the instruments
00:33 

00:33 and then the potential costs of using
00:35 

00:35 the instruments rather than lecture to
00:38 

00:38 you at this point I'd like you to
00:41 

00:41 somehow participate
00:43 

00:43 and your instructions will happen as I
00:45 

00:45 speak where I'd like you to think about
00:47 

00:47 some instruments and also their benefits
00:50 

00:50 and costs so work your way through this
00:53 

00:53 although in the exam it's a multiple
00:55 

00:56 choice exam you won't be able to write
00:58 

00:58 your ideas you won't be able to fill in
01:01 

01:01 blanks but you are
01:04 

01:04 I hope
01:05 

01:05 planning to be either a Foreign Service
01:08 

01:08 officers or maybe work in the field of
01:11 

01:11 Canadian government and so take the
01:13 

01:13 opportunity to think this through
01:14 

01:14 because it will help to make you a
01:17 

01:17 better Diplomat I hope so let's go ahead
01:22 

01:22 so put here a picture and this is all
01:25 

01:25 the worldly Goods of a person this is a
01:28 

01:28 National Geographic picture and this is
01:30 

01:30 everything that they own but you own a
01:33 

01:33 computer you actually have access to all
01:36 

01:36 the world's knowledge
01:39 

01:39 indeed when we talk about this in class
01:42 

01:42 if we were in class or in our group here
01:44 

01:44 which we are you in my class have more
01:47 

01:47 knowledge just among yourselves than all
01:51 

01:51 of the noblemen in Europe everyone in
01:53 

01:53 the medieval time period by far you know
01:56 

01:56 way more and so surely together or just
01:59 

01:59 alone like this guy in the picture you
02:01 

02:01 can figure out some military and
02:03 

02:03 non-military ideas
02:05 

02:05 your ideas so important well a country
02:08 

02:08 like Canada we have diplomatic proposals
02:11 

02:11 we have ideas we use instruments not
02:13 

02:13 just from our past but from the future
02:16 

02:16 we think of ideas and we bring them to
02:18 

02:18 the bargaining table like I said Canada
02:21 

02:21 is a member of more International
02:22 

02:22 organizations than any other country in
02:25 

02:25 the world
02:26 

02:26 it's time for us to begin with military
02:29 

02:29 instruments which Canada tends not to
02:31 

02:31 use here the most destructive obviously
02:34 

02:34 is total war total Armageddon the end of
02:37 

02:37 the world and as we talked about
02:39 

02:39 midnight this is the most destructive
02:42 

02:42 but there can also be limited Wars so
02:44 

02:44 let's talk about those
02:46 

02:46 what I want you to do is go to Wikipedia
02:49 

02:49 or to go to any site and just look up
02:51 

02:51 examples of Wars lists of Wars take a
02:54 

02:54 look at the United States the number of
02:56 

02:56 the United States has been involved in
02:57 

02:57 dozens and dozens of Wars Canada less so
03:00 

03:00 and I want you to make your own list of
03:03 

03:03 limited Wars okay
03:06 

03:06 list is going to be different from
03:08 

03:08 anybody else's but here what we're
03:10 

03:10 looking at is so that let's say you are
03:12 

03:12 in the foreign policy service of I don't
03:15 

03:15 know some
03:17 

03:17 Jamaica or China or if you're working in
03:21 

03:21 Japan I have no idea where you all are
03:23 

03:23 some of you are in you are writing to me
03:26 

03:26 in a different time zone somebody just
03:27 

03:27 passed the midterm exam and arrived here
03:31 

03:31 from China
03:32 

03:32 congratulations he did very well I'm so
03:34 

03:34 pleased for him but what I'm trying to
03:36 

03:36 say is I don't know where you all are
03:37 

03:37 but you need to think about the benefits
03:40 

03:40 and the disadvantages of using limited
03:42 

03:42 War there are some advantages to limited
03:46 

03:46 War I'm sure Vladimir Putin thought that
03:48 

03:48 there were advantages to going to war
03:50 

03:50 think of some advantages
03:52 

03:52 think of the costs of War I know a lot
03:55 

03:55 about the cost of War because I look at
03:57 

03:57 cypri and I look at organizational
03:60 

03:60 assessments and I'm very familiar with
04:02 

04:02 the costs I tend to think less about the
04:05 

04:05 benefits which is an um a problem
04:10 

04:10 think about them and then I want you to
04:12 

04:12 go on to think about alliances so here
04:15 

04:15 group it I'm trying to teach you a way
04:18 

04:18 of thinking as well where you are going
04:19 

04:19 to think in certain ways about
04:21 

04:21 instruments so here we are at the point
04:23 

04:23 of the alliances are an instrument like
04:26 

04:26 NATO like NORAD and then you can have
04:29 

04:29 permanent alliances like NATO and NORAD
04:32 

04:32 or you can have temporary alliances like
04:34 

04:34 the Coalition of willing during the Gulf
04:37 

04:37 War the Afghanistan Coalition during
04:39 

04:39 Afghanistan and right now a temporary
04:42 

04:42 alliance against Ukraine that's mainly
04:45 

04:45 the EU Canada and a lot of Western
04:47 

04:47 countries
04:48 

04:48 essentially 135 countries
04:51 

04:51 temporary Alliance so can you think of
04:53 

04:53 the cases of temporary alliances for
04:56 

04:56 example if you're interested in the
04:57 

04:57 Middle East are there any saudi-led
04:60 

04:60 alliances are there any alliances in
05:03 

05:03 history under uh Hussein pictured there
05:06 

05:06 what about Queen Elizabeth and the
05:08 

05:08 Commonwealth
05:09 

05:09 moving fairly quickly you're getting the
05:11 

05:11 idea that you are making your own
05:13 

05:13 toolbox and you need to think you can go
05:16 

05:16 back in history you can go to the 1600s
05:19 

05:19 you can go to the invasion of North
05:21 

05:21 America you can talk about the World War
05:24 

05:24 One World War II
05:26 

05:26 it depends on you but about the benefits
05:30 

05:30 and the costs of military alliances try
05:33 

05:33 to think about the benefits and the
05:35 

05:35 costs from the perspective of the
05:36 

05:36 leaders the leadership that you will be
05:38 

05:38 advising
05:40 

05:40 no you said yourself I won't be advising
05:42 

05:42 anyone on Military pressure pressure is
05:45 

05:45 used in all sorts of ways in all sorts
05:47 

05:47 of relationships and it's the use of
05:50 

05:50 military power to intimidate in order to
05:53 

05:53 convince your adversary that it's not a
05:55 

05:55 good idea to take that particular action
05:57 

05:57 so deterrence is one form of military
05:60 

05:60 pressure it's not complicated
06:03 

06:03 this involves convincing an adversary
06:05 

06:05 your enemy or maybe your friend that the
06:08 

06:08 cost of attack are guaranteed to be more
06:11 

06:11 than the cost of non-attack
06:13 

06:13 non-attacking or not attacking it's just
06:16 

06:16 telling someone that if you try to
06:19 

06:19 attack me I I the costs are going to be
06:22 

06:22 really high for you okay so that's all
06:25 

06:25 you're doing deterrence
06:27 

06:27 so what are the cases of military
06:30 

06:30 pressure here you need to go back in
06:32 

06:32 time let's say you want to go back to
06:34 

06:34 Louis XIV like I have here what are some
06:37 

06:37 of the causes what are the what are the
06:39 

06:39 cases of military pressure bombing of
06:42 

06:42 Hiroshima and nigasaki
06:44 

06:44 these pictures but you you you can
06:47 

06:47 prompt your mind by just going to Google
06:48 

06:48 image and going through and looking at
06:51 

06:51 military pressure and
06:54 

06:54 and the costs and you can get distracted
06:57 

06:57 thinking about Queen Elizabeth times and
06:59 

06:59 so on the costs of nuclear weapons are
07:01 

07:01 books have been written on this the
07:04 

07:04 costs for the world of of users
07:08 

07:08 okay I want to talk about non-military
07:11 

07:11 instruments because Canada is so good at
07:13 

07:13 this we are incredibly good as I
07:15 

07:15 lectured earlier
07:17 

07:17 um in terms of the golden age of
07:18 

07:18 Canadian diplomacy in terms of using
07:21 

07:21 diplomatic pressure either to approve or
07:24 

07:24 to disapprove so I put a picture of
07:26 

07:26 George Bush here using diplomatic
07:29 

07:29 pressure in the American diplomats are
07:31 

07:31 very good at this as well
07:33 

07:33 sometimes we say the hand in the the the
07:36 

07:36 the the fist in the in the glove or the
07:39 

07:39 velvet glove and things like that but
07:42 

07:42 some of the commonly used methods are a
07:44 

07:44 formal letter of protest I talked to you
07:46 

07:46 about that before writing a letter
07:48 

07:48 conciliatory as Pearson did or not
07:51 

07:51 withdrawing an ambassador closing an
07:53 

07:53 embassy closing our embassies in South
07:55 

07:55 Africa because of apartheid closing our
07:58 

07:58 Embassy in in China in Russia cutting
08:01 

08:02 diplomatic relations completely
08:03 

08:03 extremely effective non-military
08:05 

08:05 instruments a foreign policy that you
08:07 

08:08 need to think about and know about
08:10 

08:10 say to your boss let's say it's Napoleon
08:13 

08:13 Bonaparte here
08:15 

08:15 I hope you would never have them as your
08:17 

08:17 boss but you need to give him examples
08:19 

08:19 of using diplomatic pressures so he says
08:22 

08:22 oh yeah that's a good idea I remember
08:23 

08:23 the Iraq War Tony Blair George Bush they
08:26 

08:26 did that
08:27 

08:27 good idea so I put here a picture of
08:30 

08:30 itsak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shaking
08:34 

08:34 hands here they are actually in front of
08:36 

08:36 President Clinton who brought them
08:38 

08:38 together at Camp David they both got on
08:40 

08:40 the Nobel Peace Prize for this so think
08:43 

08:43 of historical cases
08:45 

08:45 hang on think of unsuccessful cases of
08:48 

08:48 using diplomatic pressure in here the
08:50 

08:50 one that always comes to mind is of
08:53 

08:53 course the United States decision to
08:54 

08:54 invade Iraq because they thought that
08:57 

08:57 there were weapons of mass destruction
08:58 

08:58 hidden there and that Saddam Hussein
08:60 

08:60 would use them did they think that or
09:02 

09:02 not we don't know but there's Covina the
09:05 

09:05 Secretary General of the United Nations
09:07 

09:07 and George Bush
09:09 

09:09 deciding what to do unsuccessful case in
09:13 

09:13 hindsight
09:15 

09:15 here we're thinking about the benefits
09:17 

09:17 and the advantages of using diplomatic
09:19 

09:19 pressure which can be many first it's
09:20 

09:20 obviously less costly here we have a
09:23 

09:23 Pierre Elliott Trudeau meeting with Mao
09:26 

09:26 Zedong the leader of China and he went
09:29 

09:29 to China and he went to Russia Pierre
09:31 

09:31 ellioto senior the father of Justin
09:34 

09:34 Trudeau he went to China and he met with
09:37 

09:37 the leader of China because they wanted
09:38 

09:38 to open up to China they wanted a
09:41 

09:41 measure of Dayton I also talked to you
09:44 

09:44 about a Lloyd axworthy during the
09:46 

09:46 landmines treaty here and I talked to
09:48 

09:48 you about how that was an example of
09:50 

09:50 using diplomatic pressure inviting
09:52 

09:52 countries the costs of diplomatic
09:55 

09:55 pressure are also can be high for
09:58 

09:58 example if you pressure rather than go
09:60 

09:60 to war against
10:02 

10:02 Saddam Hussein then maybe he would make
10:04 

10:04 bombs maybe he would make biological
10:06 

10:06 bombs think about it in terms of the
10:09 

10:09 past and keep going so that diplomatic
10:12 

10:12 negotiation is another instrument and
10:15 

10:15 this can be in two phases
10:17 

10:17 pre-negotiation when you are talking
10:19 

10:19 about what you're going to talk about at
10:21 

10:21 the table so I put this picture here
10:24 

10:24 he's phoning he's talking about hey do
10:26 

10:26 you want to negotiate it's not a
10:28 

10:28 negotiation yet it's trying to figure
10:30 

10:30 out the options pre-negotiation and then
10:33 

10:33 when you finally get to the table here
10:35 

10:35 you are at the table you try to identify
10:38 

10:38 the problem and you search for
10:39 

10:39 negotiations and you engage in a
10:42 

10:42 rational decision-making process
10:46 

10:46 so can you think of cases of diplomatic
10:49 

10:49 negotiation they might not be
10:50 

10:50 necessarily sitting at a table but they
10:53 

10:53 are negotiating with each other they are
10:55 

10:55 trading they are negotiating land
10:58 

10:58 they're negotiating rights think of some
11:01 

11:01 cases of diplomatic negotiation and put
11:04 

11:04 them in your mind
11:06 

11:06 is different from yours and I might be
11:08 

11:08 thinking about cases that I know about
11:10 

11:10 of negotiation but yours you might have
11:13 

11:13 different examples in your mind and you
11:15 

11:15 might think of different benefits it
11:18 

11:18 might be personal or it might be
11:19 

11:19 domestic benefits who knows
11:22 

11:22 and you need to think about the cost so
11:25 

11:25 when you're advising someone you're
11:26 

11:26 saying okay
11:27 

11:27 these are the benefits but here are the
11:30 

11:30 costs so you're you're presenting
11:32 

11:32 everything in terms of costs and
11:34 

11:34 benefits or in terms of merits and
11:37 

11:37 demerits it's a it's a successful way of
11:39 

11:39 thinking people like it
11:41 

11:41 is to our rationality
11:44 

11:44 legal instruments including
11:46 

11:46 international law are non-military
11:48 

11:48 instruments and international law is a
11:51 

11:51 body of rules that governs the conduct
11:52 

11:52 of States obviously so the scope can be
11:56 

11:56 very extensive and in human rights
11:58 

11:58 international law is also applicable to
12:01 

12:01 individuals as well as States
12:04 

12:04 this is all obvious so
12:06 

12:06 okay so international law is obvious
12:08 

12:08 because it just seems obvious to us that
12:11 

12:11 slobin and lossovich pictured here
12:13 

12:13 should be taken to court and he was the
12:16 

12:16 head of Serbia
12:17 

12:17 at the U.N the instigator really of the
12:21 

12:21 of the coast of World War and the ethnic
12:24 

12:24 cleansing that was carried on so here he
12:25 

12:25 is an international Accord where he
12:27 

12:27 actually died before he could be
12:28 

12:28 sentenced
12:31 

12:31 largely arguably sit down the stage
12:33 

12:33 should have also been brought to
12:34 

12:34 International Accord this is Saddam
12:36 

12:36 Hussein but he was dragged through the
12:38 

12:38 streets and killed
12:39 

12:39 he tried to escape
12:41 

12:41 maybe it would have been better to take
12:43 

12:43 them to International Court rather than
12:44 

12:44 kill him
12:53 

12:53 okay so can you think some of the
12:55 

12:55 benefits of international law obviously
12:57 

12:57 it's cheaper to bring people together at
12:59 

12:59 this sort of a banquet and get them to
13:01 

13:01 agree on on an international law that's
13:05 

13:05 a lot easier than going to war however
13:06 

13:06 it's not always successful there will
13:09 

13:09 always be Saddam Hussein's and Adolf
13:12 

13:12 Hitler's and Salah but on the lasovich
13:15 

13:15 is in our mind and adversaries so what
13:17 

13:17 do we do there
13:19 

13:19 the disadvantages of international law
13:21 

13:21 Are Legion and many people are very wary
13:24 

13:24 of international law particularly in the
13:27 

13:27 wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine and
13:29 

13:29 there's a lot of worry that our
13:31 

13:31 International rules-based order is being
13:34 

13:35 threatened
13:37 

13:37 you framed all this I want to introduce
13:39 

13:39 to you another instrument which is
13:41 

13:41 called csbm csbm's confidence and
13:44 

13:44 security building measures but we always
13:46 

13:46 say csbms and this is the idea of
13:49 

13:49 increasing openness and transparency
13:51 

13:51 that's why I put a picture of Gorbachev
13:53 

13:53 because he brought in the ideas of
13:55 

13:55 perestroika and glasnost glasnos means
13:58 

13:58 openness perestrochia means
14:00 

14:00 restructuring but anyway he is is
14:03 

14:03 symptomatic of that idea or symbolic of
14:06 

14:06 that idea of increasing openness about
14:09 

14:09 and transparency of among states about
14:12 

14:12 their affairs
14:13 

14:13 so having more military exercises that
14:17 

14:17 we know about
14:19 

14:19 I like the idea of csbm's I want you to
14:22 

14:22 think of some cases where csbms were
14:24 

14:24 used here's a picture of Lord Robertson
14:26 

14:26 who was NATO Secretary General meeting
14:28 

14:28 with Vladimir Putin at NATO headquarters
14:31 

14:31 trying to negotiate this was quite a
14:33 

14:33 long time ago you can tell Putin's much
14:35 

14:35 younger and it was a case where they
14:37 

14:38 were trying to build up confidence
14:41 

14:41 did it work
14:44 

14:44 some of the benefits of csbms are that
14:46 

14:46 they are cheap in the short term for
14:48 

14:48 example the landmine treaty is in itself
14:51 

14:51 a confidence building measure confidence
14:54 

14:54 and security building measure because it
14:55 

14:56 increases our confidence that the armies
14:58 

14:58 and militaries will not use
14:59 

14:59 anti-personnel mines which are very hard
15:01 

15:01 to clear from a war zone here you can
15:04 

15:04 see they're trying to get rid of such a
15:06 

15:06 dangerous job
15:07 

15:07 get rid inch by inch of land mines
15:11 

15:11 such a problem so with benefits and then
15:15 

15:15 costs the disadvantages of using csvms
15:18 

15:18 are that they're ignored you can reach
15:20 

15:20 out to North Korea or to Saudi Arabia or
15:24 

15:24 to Iraq and spend a lot of money and
15:26 

15:26 energy and you don't know if you can
15:28 

15:28 trust them now I put this picture here
15:30 

15:30 of Kim jong-un's father of Kim Jong-il
15:35 

15:35 he
15:36 

15:36 um could we have trusted him could we
15:39 

15:39 have reached out to him or not it's
15:41 

15:41 notable that he was a real a Hollywood
15:43 

15:43 film fan he had 20 000 Hollywood films
15:48 

15:48 in his collection
15:49 

15:49 I don't think he was rational we
15:52 

15:52 couldn't have reached out to him in
15:54 

15:54 hindsight could we have and we didn't
15:57 

15:57 know that it was this son that was going
15:58 

15:58 to inherit we thought it was another son
16:02 

16:02 what about reaching out to Iraq could we
16:05 

16:05 have reached out so these are some of
16:07 

16:07 the disadvantages it's it's hard to
16:09 

16:09 measure in hindsight whether these
16:11 

16:11 confidence and security building
16:12 

16:12 measures csbms
16:15 

16:15 are or were successful
