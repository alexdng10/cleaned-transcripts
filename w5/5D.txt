00:00 or to the cloud.
00:05 

00:05 Hi everyone. I'm really happy to
00:08 

00:08 introduce you to Leah Holla who is uh a
00:11 

00:11 student and also at McGill University
00:13 

00:13 studying physics has already studied
00:15 

00:15 physics.
00:16 

00:16 You know what? I've got to stop it
00:18 

00:18 because this woman, the crazy janitor,
00:20 

00:20 has come again.
00:22 

00:22 >> Just going to record the janitor going
00:24 

00:24 by. I think it's kind of amusing. We're
00:26 

00:26 we're trying to talk. Um
00:31 

00:31 and she's just going to take a little
00:32 

00:32 tour and and go away. Uh hopefully I'll
00:35 

00:35 just uh close the door. Sorry about
00:38 

00:38 this, Leah. I really
00:40 

00:40 Okay, sorry about that students. Uh the
00:43 

00:43 janitor often works late in the evening,
00:45 

00:45 but I I never know when that's going to
00:47 

00:47 happen. Um so Leah's here. Thank you
00:49 

00:49 very much. Leah's extraordinarily busy
00:51 

00:51 at today, and we'll talk about that why.
00:53 

00:53 So I was really pleased to book this
00:56 

00:56 this appointment. Um, and this week
00:58 

00:58 we're talking about the United Nations.
00:60 

01:00 So, I'm going to introduce uh Leah by
01:03 

01:03 sharing a a picture, if you don't mind,
01:06 

01:06 of um
01:10 

01:10 the United Nations. And here we are. Um,
01:16 

01:16 shouldn't have done that before. Leah,
01:19 

01:19 here we are. Our guest speaker, UN,
01:21 

01:21 former UN youth intern, Leah Holla. Uh
01:24 

01:24 so Leah uh was part of a UN initiative
01:28 

01:28 called leader for tomorrow and she's
01:30 

01:30 going to talk a little bit about that
01:31 

01:31 with us and then she became the
01:34 

01:34 executive director of the international
01:36 

01:36 physicians for the prevention of nuclear
01:38 

01:38 war which is a huge organization around
01:41 

01:41 the world and she was executive direct
01:43 

01:43 director of the Canadian uh branch which
01:46 

01:46 is also very large. Aliyah previously
01:50 

01:50 worked in um various programs and so on
01:53 

01:53 from the medical perspective and the u
01:56 

01:56 neurology perspective but now is focused
01:59 

01:59 on physics
02:01 

02:01 and then let me go to the next slide. uh
02:04 

02:04 on campus she works with well she did
02:07 

02:07 work when with students for peace and
02:09 

02:09 disarmament a group that she co-founded
02:11 

02:11 in first year and that is trying to
02:14 

02:14 still cut ties with the
02:16 

02:16 military-industrial complex by divesting
02:19 

02:19 and ceasing research for harmful weapons
02:21 

02:21 manufacturers creating a community for
02:24 

02:24 peace activism uh she also worked on
02:27 

02:27 different programs for example I
02:29 

02:29 underlined this one at Yale University
02:31 

02:31 but also a youthrun social justice
02:33 

02:33 overnight
02:34 

02:34 camp in BC on Gabriola and worked with a
02:38 

02:38 political campaigns coordinator with her
02:40 

02:40 student union and grew up surrounded by
02:42 

02:42 nature. You're a BCER from Vancouver
02:44 

02:44 Island. We'll talk a little bit about
02:46 

02:46 feminism, I hope. And I just want to
02:49 

02:49 mention this leaders for tomorrow
02:50 

02:50 program. Aliyah, is this program still
02:53 

02:53 in existence? I I see here there's a
02:55 

02:55 contact with the United Nations Office
02:58 

02:58 for Disarmament Affairs. Can you tell
02:60 

02:60 the students a little bit about that?
03:03 

03:03 happily and thank you so much for having
03:05 

03:05 me on Dr. Simpson. Um the United Nations
03:08 

03:08 Office for Disarmament Affairs has a
03:11 

03:11 youth for disarmament branch of which
03:13 

03:13 the website is right here and they have
03:15 

03:15 various annual programs that they run.
03:18 

03:18 They come out of the United Nations
03:20 

03:20 Security Council resolution I believe
03:22 

03:22 2250 on youth peace and security. Um so
03:26 

03:26 really fortunately at the highest level
03:28 

03:28 of governance it's been affirmed that
03:30 

03:30 youth and students have a role to play
03:32 

03:32 in protecting peace and security and
03:35 

03:35 engaging on nuclear disarmament. Um, so
03:37 

03:37 out of that resolution came an
03:39 

03:39 opportunity for states to give funding.
03:41 

03:41 And you'll see on the bottom left, uh,
03:43 

03:43 it says that this program was funded by
03:45 

03:45 the Republic of Korea, which generously
03:48 

03:48 gave $10 million to, um, give
03:52 

03:52 opportunities to 25 folks selected from
03:55 

03:55 around the world. And I was very um, I
03:57 

03:57 felt very fortunate to be selected as
03:59 

03:59 one of them forum.
04:01 

04:01 >> That's South Korea. That's excellent.
04:03 

04:03 And they gave how much money? They gave
04:06 

04:06 10 million which was put into a couple
04:08 

04:08 different programs, one of which was
04:10 

04:10 this program. Um so that funded various
04:13 

04:13 educational um initiatives online for us
04:16 

04:16 followed by uh over two years followed
04:19 

04:19 by um two trips to the United Nations
04:22 

04:22 during first committee week. So during
04:24 

04:24 the disarmament
04:25 

04:25 >> first committee. Okay. Let's go to the
04:27 

04:27 next slide because I just want to
04:28 

04:28 mention that your career was launched
04:31 

04:31 and here we see on Instagram still there
04:33 

04:33 uh you are part of distinguished
04:35 

04:35 speakers marking the global launch of
04:38 

04:38 UNODA's new disarmment education
04:41 

04:41 strategy. So tell us a little bit about
04:43 

04:43 this this huge initiative
04:46 

04:46 >> well funded.
04:47 

04:47 >> I've circled you in green there.
04:50 

04:50 I was grateful very grateful for for
04:53 

04:53 that opportunity and and for the OD
04:54 

04:54 staff ODA staff for setting it up and
04:57 

04:57 and ensuring youth representation on the
04:59 

04:59 panel. Um the disarmament education
05:02 

05:02 strategy was really a full circle moment
05:05 

05:05 for me because um I got involved in
05:08 

05:08 disarmament when I was in high school.
05:10 

05:10 uh a teacher had a guest on um had a
05:13 

05:13 guest come in uh Tomorrow Loren who who
05:16 

05:16 spoke on military spending and
05:17 

05:17 disarmament and I got to reading um and
05:20 

05:20 if it hadn't been for that teacher I
05:22 

05:22 wouldn't have uh or the guest speaker or
05:25 

05:25 later mentors who I met um I wouldn't
05:28 

05:28 have become involved in disarmament. So
05:31 

05:31 uh in my work later I started to work
05:33 

05:33 with with teachers and teachers unions
05:35 

05:35 giving workshops on how to teach on
05:37 

05:37 disarmament education. So uh as a member
05:40 

05:40 of the cohort they invited me to help
05:42 

05:42 launch uh to to give consultation and
05:44 

05:44 and speak at the launch of the United
05:47 

05:47 Nations disarmament education strategy.
05:49 

05:49 So this was the the first of its kind,
05:51 

05:51 the first edition in 2022.
05:54 

05:54 Um and I highly recommend reading it if
05:57 

05:57 you're interested in the arena of
05:58 

05:58 disarmament education. It's really
06:01 

06:01 really full of of advice.
06:04 

06:04 Well, there's many many interns at the
06:06 

06:06 UN that are very fortunate and that they
06:08 

06:08 get to work in New York City. I I wanted
06:12 

06:12 to show the students this picture of the
06:14 

06:14 Hudson River and the back of the UN
06:17 

06:17 where um people who are visiting never
06:20 

06:20 see uh but this is for diplomats and I
06:24 

06:24 was wondering if you ever got a chance
06:26 

06:26 to to tour this area at the back of the
06:28 

06:28 UN.
06:30 

06:30 >> Gratefully I did. Yeah. the the United
06:32 

06:32 Nations staff running the program took
06:34 

06:34 us all for a tour uh including some of
06:36 

06:36 the more offlimit areas such as the rose
06:39 

06:39 garden and you know the the UN is a very
06:42 

06:42 can be a tense environment so I think a
06:45 

06:45 lot of the most wonderful conversations
06:47 

06:47 and connections can happen in
06:49 

06:49 infrastructure like this outside by the
06:52 

06:52 roses but I felt very
06:53 

06:53 >> and that's where they smoke as well so
06:55 

06:55 you don't have to smoke to go out there
06:56 

06:56 to talk to them you can just be out
06:58 

06:58 there and talk to you know where the
06:59 

06:59 smokers
07:01 

07:01 This is uh one of the UN cafeterias. Uh
07:04 

07:04 and I was wondering if you ever had a
07:06 

07:06 chance to go here and what kind of place
07:08 

07:08 that this is.
07:11 

07:11 I yeah was grateful to have the the
07:13 

07:13 opportunity to go to the the cafeterias
07:15 

07:15 as well. I think similar to the rose
07:18 

07:18 garden, a lot of the most uh important
07:21 

07:21 meaningful conversations happen over
07:23 

07:23 food or outdoors kind of outside of the
07:26 

07:26 arena of the general assembly where
07:28 

07:28 people are are reading pre-written texts
07:31 

07:31 or responding to each other in a more um
07:35 

07:35 diplomatic way, less less free flowing.
07:38 

07:38 So, uh, yeah, the UN cafeteria and
07:41 

07:41 general spaces around the UN are more
07:44 

07:44 open for for free flowing conversation
07:46 

07:46 and people just approaching each other.
07:48 

07:48 Often if you see someone you want to
07:49 

07:49 talk to in the general assembly, you'll
07:51 

07:51 approach them after at the UN cafeteria
07:53 

07:53 or kind of follow them out into the
07:55 

07:55 hallway area after. I noticed uh on last
07:58 

07:58 week in Ottawa that you were very
08:00 

08:00 comfortable with all the diplomats and
08:03 

08:03 people from foreign affairs coming up
08:05 

08:05 and speaking to you and you I I was
08:06 

08:06 watching you and you're just completely
08:09 

08:09 comfortable with having those sorts of
08:11 

08:11 conversations and engaging. So that's
08:13 

08:13 that's this was a a good training ground
08:15 

08:15 for for what we're going to talk about
08:17 

08:17 in a few minutes. Uh my last slide here
08:20 

08:20 is the cafeteria um from a different
08:22 

08:22 perspective and where important
08:25 

08:25 information but not secret information
08:27 

08:27 is exchanged. It's information that
08:29 

08:29 diplomats want to kind of release so
08:32 

08:32 that the uh civil society knows the
08:34 

08:34 direction that they're going. So I put a
08:36 

08:36 picture here of the couches very old
08:38 

08:38 from the 1960s and that's what the
08:40 

08:40 United Nations looks like. Did you want
08:42 

08:42 to comment?
08:44 

08:44 Yeah, I this is I I think you you
08:47 

08:47 described it really accurately. There's
08:49 

08:49 also another cafeteria which is
08:51 

08:51 diplomats only. So no civil society, no
08:54 

08:54 lobbyist, nobody who's not a diplomat is
08:56 

08:56 is allowed. So if um if they want to
08:60 

08:60 have a more p private conversation,
09:01 

09:01 they'll go there. But this is this is
09:03 

09:03 where normally we approach them as as
09:05 

09:05 civil society.
09:07 

09:07 >> That's great. Um so now I wanted to talk
09:10 

09:10 with you Leah about the activities that
09:12 

09:12 you're doing now because you're very
09:15 

09:15 very effective. You've just pulled
09:17 

09:17 together I think more than 20 25 I don't
09:20 

09:20 know I'll know in a few minutes
09:22 

09:22 organizations writing a letter. So you
09:24 

09:24 drafted the letter and then of course
09:27 

09:27 you used chat or AI through McGill to
09:29 

09:29 just smooth out the letter a little to
09:31 

09:31 make it more um shorter and then uh you
09:36 

09:36 took the letter and suddenly you
09:38 

09:38 contacted all 25 organizations and asked
09:42 

09:42 each of us I'm was representing the
09:43 

09:43 Canadian Peace Research Association as
09:45 

09:45 the president to sign the letter and
09:48 

09:48 this letter do you want to tell the
09:50 

09:50 students about what motivated you to
09:52 

09:52 write the letter and why we're all
09:54 

09:54 signing it in a hurry today.
09:58 

09:58 >> Yeah. Well, I it's a collective effort
09:60 

09:60 and I'm really grateful that that folks
10:02 

10:02 are willing to to come together. Um, so
10:04 

10:04 we're just coming out of the government
10:05 

10:05 consultations in Ottawa and it feels
10:08 

10:08 like a really crucial moment and crucial
10:11 

10:11 week to be paying attention to the
10:13 

10:13 choices of world leaders and and holding
10:15 

10:15 them accountable for for the security
10:17 

10:17 not only nationally but also
10:19 

10:19 internationally. As um your students
10:22 

10:22 know, uh the New START treaty expires
10:25 

10:25 tomorrow, February or February 4th, I
10:27 

10:27 believe. Um and uh there's going to be
10:31 

10:31 no arms control on the two largest
10:34 

10:34 nuclear arsenals of which Canada is
10:36 

10:36 sandwiched. It lies right right in the
10:38 

10:38 middle. Um Canada has has a really
10:43 

10:43 important role not only geographically
10:44 

10:44 but also as a middle power. Um, and we
10:49 

10:49 live in a democracy where we're we have
10:51 

10:51 structures to hold our leaders
10:52 

10:52 accountable. Um, but one really
10:54 

10:54 unfortunate thing we're we're seeing is
10:58 

10:58 a lot of the government decisions being
11:01 

11:01 um made don't completely match with the
11:03 

11:03 rhetoric that we have been have been
11:06 

11:06 saying about our role as a middle power.
11:08 

11:08 Um, historically, Canada has played a
11:11 

11:11 role in uh, facilitating and encouraging
11:14 

11:14 arms control conversations through
11:16 

11:16 mediating diplomacy. However, right now
11:19 

11:19 we're seeing a drastic cut to all
11:23 

11:23 diplomatic endeavors, including Global
11:25 

11:25 Affairs Canada. Um, and it's not
11:27 

11:27 finalized yet, but that risks are the
11:30 

11:30 arms control unit and the disarmament
11:32 

11:32 unit. We only have a very small team of
11:35 

11:35 people who work full-time on disarmament
11:37 

11:37 and nuclear disarmament specifically.
11:39 

11:39 Um, and in despite uh no arms control
11:45 

11:45 and and major global regression and and
11:48 

11:48 the clock being set 85 seconds to
11:50 

11:50 midnight, um we're seeing that it's
11:54 

11:54 being considered that uh they cut the
11:57 

11:57 the very little resources that are that
11:60 

11:60 are being put towards our diplomatic
12:01 

12:01 efforts. So um now feels like a really
12:04 

12:04 important moment to be defending the
12:07 

12:07 existing institutions uh including
12:10 

12:10 diplomacy and diplomatic institutions
12:12 

12:12 that we have here in Canada as well as
12:14 

12:14 internationally the United Nations you
12:15 

12:15 know but for for this very moment I
12:18 

12:18 think um it's important uh
12:21 

12:21 >> yeah and your letter definitely
12:22 

12:22 underlined that in one page essentially
12:26 

12:26 that we do need to uh prioritize global
12:30 

12:30 affairs Canada and the amount amount of
12:32 

12:32 money that they spend on international
12:34 

12:34 fora like the nuclear
12:36 

12:36 non-prololiferation treaty review
12:37 

12:37 conference that's coming up this spring
12:40 

12:40 in April June and also for possibly in
12:42 

12:42 the future that Canada might attend like
12:45 

12:45 the TPNW review conference in November
12:49 

12:49 and then also you mentioned to
12:50 

12:50 disarmament education which is an
12:52 

12:52 international priority. Yeah, they were
12:54 

12:54 we're not I I need to mention to the
12:56 

12:56 students that the consultations that
12:58 

12:58 Leah and I were attending were um with
13:01 

13:01 the government and there was 20 people
13:04 

13:04 there from civil society that are
13:06 

13:06 selected as the leaders of civil society
13:08 

13:08 as representatives of different places
13:11 

13:11 and organizations and and there's also
13:14 

13:14 20 online including Tariq Ralph who we
13:16 

13:16 interviewed for the class and then there
13:19 

13:19 was another 20 people from Global
13:21 

13:21 Affairs Canada including different
13:22 

13:22 ambassadors in Geneva and so on. And all
13:25 

13:25 of them were, I got to admit, quite
13:27 

13:27 depressed because they are trying to
13:30 

13:30 figure out how to spend 15% less of
13:33 

13:33 their budget, including 15% less
13:36 

13:36 personnel. So, they were all, I would
13:38 

13:38 say, miserable. Wouldn't you, Leah? They
13:41 

13:41 were miserable at the world's situation
13:43 

13:43 and they were miserable about their own
13:45 

13:45 situations. Um, and it was sad, but
13:47 

13:47 students can still get jobs because all
13:49 

13:49 the younger ones had were not worried.
13:51 

13:51 they were still going going to be
13:53 

13:53 retained and so on. Did you want to
13:56 

13:56 mention about what they mean by chatam
13:58 

13:58 house rules when when they announced at
13:60 

13:60 the beginning chattam house rules?
14:02 

14:02 >> They always do that every single
14:04 

14:04 international for is governed by chatam
14:06 

14:06 house rules. What's your understanding?
14:10 

14:10 >> My understanding is that we can talk
14:12 

14:12 about the content that was discussed but
14:13 

14:13 cannot in attribute it to who said it.
14:16 

14:16 So we can share information that we
14:18 

14:18 gained and use it in our work. However,
14:21 

14:21 we cannot say that we heard this fact
14:24 

14:24 from this source. We can't change
14:26 

14:26 government.
14:27 

14:27 >> We we have to remember when I asked that
14:30 

14:30 one question about the the um China
14:33 

14:33 testing two nuclear weapons a week that
14:35 

14:35 was said by someone. Well, I knew full
14:37 

14:37 well it was that person who was at the,
14:40 

14:40 you know, but I just said by someone and
14:42 

14:42 then he piped up, but it was me later.
14:46 

14:46 That was so funny.
14:48 

14:48 But anyway, then I well I deliberately
14:50 

14:50 forgot it was you. Um, but it's that
14:52 

14:52 kind of informal discussion where we
14:54 

14:54 were we are allowed to say that we spoke
14:56 

14:56 at length about China and we talked a
14:58 

14:58 lot about the Golden Dome. Trump's
15:00 

15:00 vision of a Golden Dome. Um, what else
15:03 

15:03 do we talk about? It was a long
15:06 

15:06 discussion. Um, many many things uh but
15:08 

15:08 but the whole point being they are
15:10 

15:10 consulting with us in Ottawa and with
15:14 

15:14 different organizations. So I was very
15:16 

15:16 impressed. you spoke a couple of times
15:19 

15:19 by by and and the way they do it is you
15:21 

15:21 have to put your name tag up and then
15:23 

15:23 they the chair recognizes you and then
15:25 

15:25 they focus fully on you including on the
15:27 

15:27 big screen. So there's four huge screens
15:30 

15:30 and then there's 12 screens in front of
15:32 

15:32 us. So it's blasting. Tell us a little
15:35 

15:35 bit about how you got up the courage to
15:38 

15:38 speak in in front of such a large group
15:41 

15:41 of experts because you did really well
15:43 

15:43 twice.
15:45 

15:45 Well, thank you very much, Erica. I I
15:48 

15:48 feel very grateful um to have also been
15:50 

15:50 encouraged to speak by yourself and
15:52 

15:52 other members of civil society. Um in
15:57 

15:57 advance, I put some time into thinking
15:59 

15:59 about uh what priorities were going into
16:02 

16:02 the meeting and including um thinking
16:05 

16:05 about what other people were saying and
16:07 

16:07 having notes on things that I didn't
16:09 

16:09 want to be left unsaid. Um, one of which
16:12 

16:12 included the rolling back of Canada's
16:14 

16:14 feminist foreign policy, which is really
16:17 

16:17 >> disappointing in in the context of
16:18 

16:18 global gender aggression. Um, that was
16:21 

16:21 the second remark and I I waited till
16:23 

16:23 the end to see if it would come up by
16:24 

16:24 another.
16:25 

16:25 >> Yeah, you waited and no one brought it
16:26 

16:26 up except for you, which was shocking.
16:29 

16:29 Um, it was like Trudeau's feminist
16:31 

16:31 policy just went out the window and then
16:34 

16:34 finally Leah brings it up and we all go,
16:35 

16:35 "Oh, oh, right. Oh, right. We're
16:37 

16:37 supposed to be talking about that." Oh,
16:39 

16:39 yeah. Good for you. Good for you.
16:42 

16:42 >> Well, I mean, it it's uh it's definitely
16:44 

16:44 a frightening time when there's so many
16:47 

16:47 issues at hand. Um, and but they're
16:50 

16:50 they're all inextricably connected and I
16:52 

16:52 I don't think it does nuclear
16:54 

16:54 disarmament any favors to be rolling
16:57 

16:57 back language on gender. I mean, I think
16:59 

16:59 a lot of also nuclear weapons dialogue
17:02 

17:02 is is spoken about in a hyper masculine
17:05 

17:05 masculine way. At least my perspective,
17:07 

17:07 not necessarily any of the orgs I work
17:09 

17:09 for, that they by working on nuclear
17:11 

17:11 disarmament, you're you're um furthering
17:13 

17:13 gender justice. And by working on gender
17:14 

17:14 justice, you're furthering um you're
17:17 

17:17 furthering disarmament policy. And and
17:22 

17:22 >> did you notice when you worked for
17:23 

17:23 International Physicians against uh oh
17:25 

17:25 boy, IPW? Tell me again what it is.
17:28 

17:28 International
17:30 

17:30 >> the International Physicians for the
17:31 

17:31 Prevention of Nuclear War Canada.
17:32 

17:32 >> Thank you. Okay, I keep forgetting. Um,
17:35 

17:35 did you notice that they were focused on
17:37 

17:37 a more feminist uh approach or or a more
17:41 

17:41 gender
17:43 

17:43 >> gender justice?
17:45 

17:45 >> Yeah, I I don't think well I don't think
17:48 

17:48 anyone in the or many people in the or
17:50 

17:50 are against that approach by any means.
17:53 

17:53 The specifics of IBPNW is a health
17:56 

17:56 focus. So looking at nuclear weapons
17:60 

17:60 from a medical perspective um which I
18:03 

18:03 was very grateful to do and to learn in
18:05 

18:05 that space. It's very it's
18:07 

18:07 evidence-based and and speaking from the
18:10 

18:10 facts and it's a matter of fact that the
18:13 

18:13 only the only way to cure a nuclear
18:16 

18:16 disaster is prevention. Medicine has
18:18 

18:18 nothing to offer in the face of of
18:20 

18:20 nuclear warfare. So, um, for example,
18:24 

18:24 uh, like a a paralleled note would be
18:26 

18:26 that, uh, once, uh, the NRA tweeted, um,
18:30 

18:30 doctors need to stay in their lane and
18:31 

18:31 anti-gun need doctors need to stay in
18:33 

18:33 their lane. Um, but it was, I think, um,
18:36 

18:36 a member of the American IPB&W tweeted
18:39 

18:39 back, um, we are the people who see the
18:42 

18:42 bullet holes. We we treat the outcomes.
18:44 

18:44 So, you know, prevention is the only
18:46 

18:46 way, and I think paralleled with with
18:48 

18:48 nuclear weapons, the only way forward is
18:49 

18:49 is a prohibition. Um but I was grateful
18:53 

18:53 to
18:55 

18:55 while working with IPBW volunteer with
18:57 

18:57 Canadian Voice of Women for Peace,
18:58 

18:58 Women's International League of Peace
18:60 

18:60 and Freedom. Uh Ray Aerson who you
19:02 

19:02 mentioned was in one of the photos um
19:04 

19:04 read a lot of their writing. Carol Khan
19:07 

19:07 um I think feminist literature and was a
19:10 

19:10 part of my thinking.
19:12 

19:12 >> Very interesting. Well, what that does
19:14 

19:14 um uh lead me to talk not I I'm so
19:18 

19:18 fascinated by this, but we do have to
19:19 

19:19 keep our recording to approximately 15
19:21 

19:21 minutes is um if you you were the
19:24 

19:24 executive director and now you're you're
19:27 

19:27 actually going back to school to do more
19:29 

19:29 physics and you were telling me that
19:31 

19:31 you're learning more French, 10 hours a
19:33 

19:33 week of French. So, I was wondering why
19:36 

19:36 you're doing that. Do you think that you
19:37 

19:37 need to be fluently bilingual? because I
19:39 

19:39 noticed last week in Ottawa that most of
19:41 

19:41 the foreign service officers were not
19:44 

19:44 fluently bilingual, only a few. But then
19:46 

19:46 you could see that their careers might
19:48 

19:48 be advancing quicker. Um, so that was
19:51 

19:51 one of my has always been my thought
19:52 

19:52 that if you are fluently bilingual and
19:56 

19:56 French is your first language too, then
19:58 

19:58 that gives you more opportunities not
19:59 

19:59 just in uh the Department of Global
20:02 

20:02 Affairs Canada now, but also in
20:04 

20:04 Department of National Defense or in the
20:06 

20:06 Privy Council office. Do you want to
20:08 

20:08 talk a little bit about why you're
20:09 

20:09 learning French?
20:11 

20:11 >> Yeah, happily. Um, I mean, I feel like
20:13 

20:13 French is a really good a very practical
20:15 

20:15 investment of my time. So, I'm trying to
20:17 

20:17 get to the level of fluency as fast as
20:19 

20:19 possible. Um, I think I I stepped down
20:22 

20:22 from my PBNWC to take a little time to
20:25 

20:25 invest in my own education. I don't
20:27 

20:27 think that's something I'll ever regret.
20:29 

20:29 And I, yeah, French feels like a very
20:32 

20:32 practical use for many fields. I know I
20:36 

20:36 want to work internationally or at a
20:39 

20:39 minimum um
20:42 

20:42 on international issues. Um and to be
20:44 

20:44 able to speak in both Canada second
20:46 

20:46 language and a UN language feels feels
20:48 

20:48 worthwhile.
20:51 

20:51 >> That's great. That's really positive. Um
20:53 

20:53 and I've told the students before about
20:55 

20:55 the explore program that they can apply
20:57 

20:57 for uh in order to take French at a
20:60 

20:60 university even in New Brunswick uh or
21:02 

21:02 even in Toronto at Glendon. And you're
21:05 

21:05 learning French as well. Are you What
21:07 

21:07 program are you using? Just for the
21:08 

21:08 students to know, is it Dualingo?
21:11 

21:11 >> Sure. Yeah, I I uh I actually did
21:13 

21:13 explore a couple years ago. I highly
21:15 

21:15 recommend that as well. Um and I use
21:18 

21:18 Dualingo and also I'm taking courses in
21:20 

21:20 my community in Montreal. Um
21:23 

21:23 >> yes, you're in Montreal, so therefore
21:25 

21:25 you're being immersed right away. Oh,
21:26 

21:26 that's wonderful. Um well, thank you,
21:28 

21:28 Leah. I really appreciate this
21:30 

21:30 opportunity and I'm sure you motivated
21:32 

21:32 uh students to think about working if
21:35 

21:35 they can't work for the UN or let's say
21:37 

21:37 they're a nurse or they're they're in uh
21:39 

21:39 aviation. Can they somehow can work for
21:42 

21:42 what you said the other day the greater
21:44 

21:44 good? What can you want to end on those
21:47 

21:47 kind of comments about how people can
21:49 

21:49 perhaps not even you don't have to work
21:52 

21:52 for the UN to work for the greater good?
21:55 

21:55 >> Absolutely. I mean, there's a role for
21:58 

21:58 all of us to play. You there's no
21:60 

21:60 onesizefitsall
22:01 

22:01 or one path to to contributing to
22:04 

22:04 nuclear disarmament or these issues at
22:07 

22:07 large. Um I say just find what you're
22:09 

22:09 passionate about, find find it what
22:11 

22:11 you're passionate about, find what
22:12 

22:12 you're good at, whether that's writing,
22:14 

22:14 whether that's art, whether that's
22:15 

22:15 science, whether that's health, and um
22:18 

22:18 find be creative in in applying it. And
22:22 

22:22 we need people from all different
22:24 

22:24 backgrounds thinking about these issues
22:26 

22:26 um and working on them. You know, the
22:28 

22:28 the chances are that we'll only be able
22:30 

22:30 to make a small difference, but it's
22:32 

22:32 very important that you try and make
22:34 

22:34 that small difference because it's going
22:35 

22:35 to take all of us um in order to to
22:38 

22:38 protect our world and especially in the
22:41 

22:41 state of current affairs. So, um I hope
22:44 

22:44 I hope that I hope that that's
22:47 

22:47 >> well those words are very very inspiring
22:48 

22:48 and I and I want to thank you again Leah
22:50 

22:50 for taking time out of out of this very
22:52 

22:52 very busy day for coming on and also um
22:56 

22:56 I wish you luck in the future with
22:57 

22:57 whatever endeavors you take on. I'm sure
22:59 

22:59 you'll be very successful. Thank you.
23:02 

23:02 >> Thanks for the invitation. Happy to be
23:04 

23:04 here.
