00:01 5B on the United Nations a primer so
00:04 

00:04 we're learning about the United Nations
00:07 

00:07 more especially about
00:11 

00:11 peacekeeping what is the pr Preamble of
00:14 

00:14 the UN Charter that was written in 1945
00:17 

00:17 well it states its founding int
00:19 

00:19 intention is to save succeeding
00:22 

00:22 Generations from the scourge of War this
00:24 

00:24 means to save future Generations from
00:26 

00:26 the horror of warfare it's not there
00:29 

00:29 because of Western desires to uh let's
00:32 

00:32 say uh ensure lower tariffs or Liberty
00:35 

00:35 or democracy it's there to prevent
00:38 

00:38 conflict and to promote lasting
00:43 

00:43 peace why do I say that because exact
00:45 

00:45 wording counts and if you listen
00:47 

00:47 carefully to Ambassador Mason and
00:49 

00:49 Professor Dorne you'll hear them weigh
00:51 

00:51 their words very carefully they're
00:53 

00:53 always making sure that what they write
00:55 

00:55 and what they say very very careful
00:58 

00:58 people similarly to these Canadians
01:01 

01:01 pictured here who are employed to try to
01:03 

01:03 interpret what the UN is saying uh and
01:06 

01:06 they have a newsletter called reaching
01:08 

01:08 critical will very a lot of uh diplomats
01:10 

01:10 pay more attention to them it's
01:14 

01:14 easier Ray aters she's actually from
01:16 

01:16 yuron college she learned to write at
01:18 

01:18 yon congratulations okay moving on
01:22 

01:22 talking about the blue helmets of the
01:23 

01:23 peacekeepers the White Tanks and the
01:26 

01:26 current un Ambassador Bob Ray uh who was
01:30 

01:30 an ND Pier but is now the uh appointed
01:33 

01:33 by the liberal government to be the
01:35 

01:35 ambassador you can see him there and
01:38 

01:38 there's another picture of him in front
01:39 

01:39 of the UN flag so the UN flag is blue
01:43 

01:43 and the main conflict Provisions are in
01:46 

01:46 chapter 6 and seven of the UN CH uh
01:50 

01:50 Charter let's talk about chapter six
01:53 

01:53 which encourages member states to
01:54 

01:54 resolve their disputes by different
01:57 

01:57 methods and these might be negotiations
02:01 

02:01 mediation they might be
02:04 

02:04 arbitration think of these as different
02:07 

02:07 ways to resolve conflict and they have
02:10 

02:10 their other peaceful means so these are
02:13 

02:13 approaches that are valid and they are
02:16 

02:16 representative of peaceful dispute
02:19 

02:19 resolution not threats and
02:22 

02:22 War Chapter 7 of the UN Charter is is is
02:25 

02:25 key to the un's collective security
02:28 

02:28 function the UN is a collective security
02:31 

02:31 organization it's not a collective
02:33 

02:33 defense organization so under chapter 7
02:36 

02:36 of the charter the UN Security Council
02:38 

02:38 can call on member states to implement
02:41 

02:41 measures that do not involve the use of
02:44 

02:44 force such as a ceasefire um measures
02:47 

02:47 often take the form of sanctions and
02:49 

02:49 deian plov will talk to us about these
02:51 

02:51 sanctions against Russia and many other
02:54 

02:54 countries that he's involved in imposing
02:56 

02:56 uh that's another guest speaker that we
02:58 

02:58 have that I'm excited about coming to
03:00 

03:00 talk about embargos restrictions on
03:02 

03:02 financial interactions and restriction
03:05 

03:05 on access to overseas assets which has
03:08 

03:08 been
03:09 

03:09 done okay Article 4 can be invoked this
03:13 

03:13 is the Article of the UN Charter that
03:15 

03:15 permits the security Council to actually
03:18 

03:18 authorize the use of force including
03:21 

03:21 armed peacekeepers if non-military
03:24 

03:24 measures prove inadequate how can those
03:27 

03:27 actions take place by air sea or land
03:31 

03:31 such as demonstrations blockades and
03:33 

03:33 other operations that are carried out by
03:36 

03:36 UN member states to maintain or restore
03:40 

03:40 International Peace and security peace
03:43 

03:43 and
03:43 

03:43 security what does invoked
03:47 

03:47 mean uh invoked means to cite or appeal
03:50 

03:50 to something as an authority so I put a
03:53 

03:53 picture here of Antonio gutterz the
03:56 

03:56 current SE genen and here he is invoking
03:60 

03:60 uh so they're considered to to to be
04:02 

04:02 trying to they're an authority and
04:04 

04:04 they're trying to make an argument here
04:06 

04:06 are some diplomats arguing about the
04:09 

04:09 wording for invoking they're arguing I
04:12 

04:12 that's what it is at the UN you can see
04:13 

04:13 them with these pieces of paper arguing
04:16 

04:16 it's quite
04:18 

04:18 cool here's un Secretary General Antonio
04:21 

04:21 gues he invoked uh article 99 which is
04:23 

04:23 hardly ever been invoked before um
04:26 

04:26 indeed according to the UN spokesperson
04:30 

04:30 it has not been used for decades ceras
04:33 

04:33 reiterated his appeal for a humanitarian
04:36 

04:36 uh ceasefire in the Gaz strip under
04:39 

04:39 article 99 of the UN Charter uh in order
04:43 

04:43 and this was urgent because the he
04:45 

04:45 argued the civilian population must be
04:47 

04:47 spared from greater harm well that
04:48 

04:48 ceasefire never came into
04:52 

04:52 place the department of peacekeeping
04:55 

04:55 operations could have been invoked and
04:57 

04:57 brought into the Gaza Strip or it could
04:60 

05:00 uh be invoked in uh any kind of conflict
05:03 

05:03 Nepal uh we'll talk more about the
05:05 

05:05 different un peacekeeping operations
05:07 

05:07 currently but dpko is where Ambassador
05:10 

05:10 Peggy Mason has worked for many years
05:12 

05:12 she's very very familiar with it and uh
05:15 

05:15 she's going to talk to us about
05:17 

05:17 different peacekeeping operations right
05:19 

05:19 now there's 11 of them led by DP KO they
05:23 

05:23 always say dpko and this is notable
05:25 

05:25 given that peacekeeping was never
05:27 

05:27 actually explicitly mentioned in the UN
05:29 

05:29 chart yet it's the Cornerstone it's
05:32 

05:32 extremely important to the un's efforts
05:34 

05:34 to maintain International Peace and
05:38 

05:38 security this is a very useful site the
05:41 

05:41 United Nations peacekeeping org what is
05:43 

05:43 peacekeeping for learning about un
05:45 

05:45 peacekeeping and it changes very
05:47 

05:47 frequently for example last year's
05:48 

05:48 course notes say that there were are uh
05:51 

05:51 12 peacekeeping operations now there's
05:53 

05:53 11 and if you select 12 on the quiz well
05:56 

05:56 then it's wrong and so it's very
05:59 

05:59 important to listen to the lectures and
06:01 

06:01 update your notes don't rely on notes
06:04 

06:04 from previous
06:07 

06:07 years I have talked for years about UNF
06:10 

06:10 one and that's because uh it's a very
06:12 

06:12 famous crisis uh involving the Hungarian
06:16 

06:16 crisis and the Suz crisis and Dr uh
06:19 

06:19 Doran will explain it in a bit more
06:21 

06:21 detail I'm hoping but that was the first
06:24 

06:24 United Nations emergency Force called
06:26 

06:26 UNF one and that was the first time that
06:29 

06:29 peacekeeping forces were used Canada
06:31 

06:31 actually uh contributed forces to UNF
06:37 

06:37 one Canada contributed forces because of
06:40 

06:40 uh he wasn't prime minister yet but uh
06:43 

06:43 Lester B Pearson was a diplomat Who
06:45 

06:45 provided a draft resolution and
06:47 

06:47 presented it to the journal assembly for
06:50 

06:50 approval and that was he wrote it and
06:52 

06:52 that move was pivotal in the development
06:54 

06:54 of modern peacekeeping efforts Canada
06:58 

06:58 eventually got actually the Nobel Peace
06:60 

06:60 prize in 1958 for proposing a un
07:03 

07:03 peacekeeping Force so there's uh uh
07:06 

07:06 Pearson uh with the Nobel Peace Prize
07:10 

07:10 back in 1958 be well before he became
07:13 

07:13 prime
07:15 

07:15 minister what about traditional first
07:17 

07:17 generation peacekeeping we we don't use
07:20 

07:20 this nomenclature so much anymore but uh
07:23 

07:23 perhaps uh Peggy will say first second
07:26 

07:26 third fourth generation peacekeeping uh
07:28 

07:28 let's talk about what that is
07:30 

07:30 traditional
07:32 

07:32 peacekeeping traditional uh first
07:34 

07:34 generation peacekeeping was uh impartial
07:38 

07:38 so both sides were supposed to be uh
07:41 

07:41 neutral or all sides were supposed to
07:43 

07:43 remain neutral um now peacekeepers can
07:46 

07:46 be fighting for the state or against
07:48 

07:48 Rebels they may not be neutral but then
07:51 

07:51 back then they were supposed to be
07:53 

07:53 neutral back then they were supposed to
07:55 

07:55 be lightly armed that meant that they
07:57 

07:57 were not armed with uh guns or tanks
07:60 

07:60 they were supposed to be actually
08:02 

08:02 minimal um and in the end some
08:04 

08:04 peacekeepers got hacked to death in
08:06 

08:06 along the North Korean demilitarized
08:09 

08:09 zone I saw that that area myself um
08:12 

08:12 because they were not def able to defend
08:14 

08:14 themselves it also used to require all
08:17 

08:17 parties approval uh for example in
08:19 

08:19 Cyprus all the parties turkey and Greece
08:21 

08:21 were supposed to be in agreement for the
08:23 

08:23 peacekeeping force and it's supposed to
08:26 

08:26 be non-territorial in that it's supposed
08:28 

08:28 to avoid seizing territory but now it
08:31 

08:31 can so peacekeeping has definitely
08:32 

08:32 evolved from the 19 40s and 50s
08:37 

08:37 60s and what is the second generation
08:40 

08:40 the second generation beginning in the
08:42 

08:42 1990s this is kind of the height of
08:44 

08:44 peacekeeping in the world 199s 95 third
08:47 

08:47 generation here um basically they
08:50 

08:50 expanded it to include enforcement which
08:53 

08:53 some people will say is robust
08:55 

08:55 peacekeeping and some people will call
08:56 

08:56 Modern peacekeeping where it's much more
08:59 

08:59 uh robust much more um violent and then
09:03 

09:03 third generation is more complex and
09:05 

09:05 focuses on peace building a lot of
09:07 

09:07 people don't use third generation very
09:09 

09:09 properly and then fourth generation is
09:12 

09:12 when you're trying to build a state
09:14 

09:14 you're trying like Afghanistan and
09:16 

09:16 you're trying to build in all sorts of
09:18 

09:18 electoral activities and voting uh
09:20 

09:20 you're having Regional organizations
09:22 

09:22 involved and so on so most peacekeeping
09:24 

09:24 now is fourth
09:27 

09:27 generation but let's go back to second
09:29 

09:29 gener ation so second generation modern
09:31 

09:31 peacekeeping here you can see that they
09:33 

09:33 are armed they may not be neutral they
09:36 

09:36 are deployed between states or within
09:39 

09:39 States uh they can operate without
09:42 

09:42 consent if no central government agrees
09:44 

09:44 to it like in Afghanistan there was no
09:46 

09:46 central government of uh for a while
09:49 

09:49 they can use force and then they can be
09:52 

09:52 deployed doing electoral monitoring or
09:55 

09:55 humanitarian relief Dr Dorne has a great
09:57 

09:57 deal of experience uh on electoral
09:59 

09:59 support humanitarian operations in um uh
10:05 

10:05 I can't quite remember what if it was
10:06 

10:06 Nepal I can't Point remember where oh
10:08 

10:08 East teamour he was involved in the
10:11 

10:11 election in in East
10:14 

10:14 teamour he might tell you about that
10:16 

10:16 because it was extremely disturbing uh
10:18 

10:18 he was on CBC radio and when he was in
10:20 

10:20 East teamour and watched people being
10:22 

10:22 burned alive in a church I'm not sure
10:25 

10:25 that we'll talk about that but let's
10:26 

10:26 talk about unir unir unir which some
10:29 

10:29 people say was a total failure uh
10:32 

10:32 because it preent it failed to prevent
10:35 

10:35 the genocide in Rwanda so was it a
10:39 

10:39 failure the genocide in in Rwanda um
10:42 

10:42 okay so following the creation of a
10:45 

10:45 here's Romeo deir who was the general in
10:48 

10:48 charge of the peacekeeping operation who
10:50 

10:50 happened to be a Canadian General Romeo
10:52 

10:52 deir and he appealed to the UN for
10:56 

10:56 peacekeeping troops for for anything for
10:60 

10:60 any kind of CW uh help um in the
11:03 

11:03 operation and so how many did he get if
11:06 

11:06 this was a multiple choice question zero
11:08 

11:08 he got absolutely zero no countries
11:11 

11:11 committed to try to prevent the genocide
11:14 

11:14 in Rwanda zero no countries I say that
11:16 

11:16 with great emphasis because at that time
11:18 

11:18 it was just a terrible terrible
11:21 

11:21 situation terrible in October 1993 6
11:25 

11:25 months after he's still calling for
11:27 

11:27 troops unamir deployed 550 troops so how
11:32 

11:32 many troops did the UN deploy in Rwanda
11:34 

11:34 in the end 550 people that's it you
11:37 

11:37 think that there would have the world
11:39 

11:39 would have come to their aid and had
11:41 

11:41 would have deployed as many as in
11:43 

11:43 Afghanistan tens of thousands but no
11:46 

11:46 only 550
11:48 

11:48 people now Romeo deir says that he could
11:52 

11:52 have prevented rwanda's genocide with
11:54 

11:54 just 5,000 troops if if the United
11:57 

11:57 Nations had said that and he was quite
12:00 

12:00 traumatized by that uh he has what's
12:03 

12:03 called post-traumatic stress disorder
12:05 

12:05 PTSD and this is a mental health
12:08 

12:08 disorder due to having U witnessed the
12:11 

12:11 genocide and and literally thousands of
12:13 

12:13 people being killed driving through uh
12:17 

12:17 streets of of tortured and killed people
12:21 

12:21 um I put a picture here of thinker Lodge
12:24 

12:24 which is in Nova Scotia which is run by
12:26 

12:26 the international pugwash movement and
12:27 

12:27 the Canadian government and I was at a
12:30 

12:30 conference with Romeo deair seated right
12:32 

12:32 there and I'm an early riser I was up at
12:35 

12:35 about 5: in the morning and he came out
12:36 

12:36 and was talking to me right there and he
12:39 

12:39 said he can't couldn't sleep he often
12:41 

12:41 that just the images of all the uh
12:44 

12:44 slaughtered people uh kept him
12:48 

12:48 awake okay so Canada uh decided uh to
12:52 

12:52 put together a proposal for a rapid
12:55 

12:55 reaction capability for the UN and this
12:57 

12:57 was a proposal that was presented Ed by
12:60 

12:60 the government of Canada to the United
13:02 

13:02 Nations but the United States opposed it
13:05 

13:05 and and behind the scenes um pushed
13:07 

13:07 countries to vote against it I was very
13:10 

13:10 intimately involved in in the writing of
13:12 

13:12 this in Monte Bello and that was due to
13:15 

13:15 my work on the peacekeeping training
13:17 

13:17 center but um also the report is still I
13:21 

13:21 think interesting but you don't have to
13:23 

13:23 look at
13:24 

13:24 it I've worked on a whole bunch of
13:26 

13:26 different proposals to do with
13:27 

13:27 peacekeeping and I I was making a list
13:30 

13:30 here um since
13:31 

13:31 1991 and even a few weeks ago I wrote an
13:35 

13:35 article for the globe in mail on um 2024
13:38 

13:38 a peacekeeping force could be the
13:40 

13:40 Innovation the Canada US border needs
13:42 

13:42 which the globan mail published uh so
13:45 

13:45 I've worked on a un unf's emergency
13:48 

13:48 Force the responsibility RT r2p and so
13:51 

13:51 on so when I talked to Peggy um we do
13:54 

13:54 tend to use the language of peacekeeping
13:56 

13:56 a bit and this primer gives you some of
13:58 

13:58 those words ahead of time I'm not
14:01 

14:01 expecting you to be an expert on
14:02 

14:02 peacekeeping but I want you to to be
14:04 

14:04 enthusiastic about something like
14:08 

14:08 that okay what would you contribute
14:10 

14:10 let's say you were a country or you're
14:12 

14:12 acting on behalf of a delegation um you
14:14 

14:14 can look at the CIA World Factbook and
14:17 

14:17 it will give you the uh numbers of
14:20 

14:20 military personnel and the kind of
14:21 

14:21 equipment that your country has let's
14:23 

14:23 say you're representing Chad or or
14:26 

14:26 something like that um so let's say if
14:29 

14:29 your pretend you're a country I don't
14:30 

14:30 know what country you want to be India
14:32 

14:32 Jamaica Trinidad
14:34 

14:34 Tobago take a look at the CIA World fact
14:37 

14:37 book and then ask yourself what forces
14:39 

14:39 and capabilities you might be willing to
14:42 

14:42 make to available to the UN on short
14:44 

14:44 notice I'm very curious what you think
14:46 

14:46 but of course with a multiple choice
14:48 

14:48 exam and with so many students and and
14:51 

14:51 really no help um to Mark at zero um and
14:55 

14:55 also I'm not supposed to ask you to
14:56 

14:56 write anything I I can't get your
14:58 

14:58 opinions I don't know know like on
14:60 

14:60 behalf of Haiti what would you offer
15:03 

15:03 don't have much um for the UN
15:04 

15:04 peacekeeping Force who's in charge of
15:06 

15:06 that now a John Manza Dr John Manza who
15:09 

15:09 came to our class is in charge of the
15:11 

15:11 Canada United States France Force to
15:15 

15:15 help Haiti Haiti has no resources uh so
15:18 

15:18 what would we contribute what would the
15:20 

15:20 UN you know what could you give um
15:22 

15:22 instead of uh just just think about what
15:25 

15:25 you would give on behalf of a country
15:26 

15:26 even like
15:28 

15:28 Canada okay I think that's it um oh I I
15:33 

15:33 decid to ask chat and this what's my
15:34 

15:34 lesson here chat let's say if we had a
15:37 

15:37 multiple choice question and you could
15:39 

15:39 answer it well what would chat of course
15:41 

15:41 it's very general um it's very agreeable
15:44 

15:44 and it's it doesn't really um tell us
15:47 

15:47 anything here but that's the other
15:49 

15:49 problem with multiple choice um and chat
15:52 

15:52 is chat will give these sorts of
15:55 

15:55 answers okay so that wasn't the end of
15:57 

15:57 my lecture because now I remember I had
15:59 

15:59 this very important picture of the UN um
16:02 

16:02 constantly undergoing
16:03 

16:03 restoration and here um I think that it
16:07 

16:07 is very important to state that if we
16:09 

16:09 didn't have the UN we'd have to invent
16:11 

16:11 it and people always say that Bob Ray
16:14 

16:14 and others that the United Nations sure
16:17 

16:17 there are a lot of problems there's lack
16:19 

16:19 of funding uh there's division the
16:21 

16:21 charter has no uh police force but the
16:24 

16:24 UN is a place for different countries
16:26 

16:26 and ideologies to talk we can't EXP
16:29 

16:29 expect a lot of action they just don't
16:31 

16:31 have the resources they don't have the
16:32 

16:32 armed Personnel but it is a place to
16:35 

16:35 talk a lot and so here this is I took
16:37 

16:37 this photo standing uh talking to guy
16:40 

16:40 Roberts who'd come from NATO uh and I
16:43 

16:43 was there because of the United Nations
16:45 

16:45 and so we were chatting here
16:47 

16:47 talking and I took the picture because
16:49 

16:49 then he saw Rebecca coming toward him uh
16:53 

16:53 at full speed because she saw because
16:55 

16:55 he's from the United States he's in
16:56 

16:56 favor of deterrence and she's from the
16:58 

16:58 United Kingdom him and she's was oh um
17:02 

17:02 in favor of nuclear abolition and he
17:05 

17:05 actually started he grabbed me by the
17:06 

17:06 elbow and we he started dragging me
17:08 

17:08 running in the opposite direction away
17:10 

17:10 from Rebecca and I always remember that
17:12 

17:12 because I was wearing high heels I've
17:13 

17:13 learned since then not to wear high
17:15 

17:15 heels at the UN because you want to talk
17:18 

17:18 a lot and it's all talk no walk
17:21 

17:21 according to Trump but I think it's
17:22 

17:22 still a valuable place it's a talk shop
17:24 

17:24 for the world a global cafeteria it's
17:26 

17:26 sort of a form of a global comments
17:29 

17:29 thank you for listening I hope my
17:32 

17:32 enthusiasm for the UN is is catching
