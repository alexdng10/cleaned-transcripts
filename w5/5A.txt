00:01 Welcome to lesson 5A uh 5.1 introduction
00:05 

00:05 to the United Nations and Global
00:07 

00:07 Governance. So, we've moved from
00:09 

00:09 peacekeeping to talking more now about
00:11 

00:11 the United Nations and peacekeeping, the
00:14 

00:14 UN budget, and we'll also then be moving
00:17 

00:17 forward to talk about global governance.
00:19 

00:19 So, here's a picture of the United
00:21 

00:21 Nations Security Council, which I'll
00:24 

00:24 explain in a few minutes what that is.
00:26 

00:26 And this is the corridors of the UN. As
00:29 

00:29 you can see, pe there's a people are not
00:32 

00:32 allowed to leave papers like this and
00:35 

00:35 information. So that's highly unusual.
00:40 

00:40 I put a picture here of the United
00:41 

00:41 Nations. Um the secretariat, the
00:44 

00:44 security council and the general
00:45 

00:45 assembly are the main parts of the UN in
00:49 

00:49 the UN building here. So, I'm not going
00:52 

00:52 to explain too much about the function
00:54 

00:54 of the secretariat, but I am going to
00:57 

00:57 talk quite a lot about the general
00:59 

00:59 assembly and the security council.
01:02 

01:02 Here's a picture that I took of the UN
01:05 

01:05 Rose Garden on the Hudson River. The the
01:09 

01:09 um Rose Garden itself is not any longer
01:12 

01:12 open to the public, only to register
01:15 

01:15 diplomats with a security card. And
01:19 

01:19 because of the lack of land and also I
01:22 

01:22 would say because of the movement of
01:25 

01:25 President Trump to criticize the United
01:27 

01:27 Nations heavily criticize it that land
01:30 

01:30 may someday have to be sold and made
01:32 

01:32 into an apartments and maybe the UN will
01:35 

01:35 move to Ottawa. We don't know why
01:38 

01:38 because President Trump is very very
01:40 

01:40 critical of the United Nations.
01:43 

01:43 He addressed the we call them sessions
01:45 

01:45 of the United Nations General Assembly.
01:48 

01:48 He's addressed it before as has
01:50 

01:50 President Biden and President Obama and
01:53 

01:53 um soon Prime Minister Carney possibly.
01:57 

01:57 Uh he delivered his remarks on September
02:00 

02:00 23rd, 2025. And that's a picture of him
02:03 

02:03 just as he's delivering the remarks.
02:07 

02:07 And here he is talking about how the
02:10 

02:10 United Nations he he essentially blasts
02:12 

02:12 it. So, I did put a link in the previous
02:15 

02:15 video, but I'm not asking you to go to
02:17 

02:17 the White House and watch the entire
02:19 

02:19 video. Uh, it's very long and he
02:23 

02:23 suggests that the United Nations either
02:25 

02:25 ignored or exasperated problems made
02:28 

02:28 them worse around the world and that he
02:31 

02:31 has to these are being left to him to
02:33 

02:33 fix. What is the purpose of the United
02:36 

02:36 Nations? He Trump asked it is not even
02:39 

02:39 coming close to living up to potential.
02:42 

02:42 Uh and in his speech which was very
02:45 

02:45 typical as we've learned about President
02:47 

02:47 Trump, he meanders about complaining and
02:51 

02:51 also complained that um he lost a
02:54 

02:54 contract uh to um renovate the UN
02:57 

02:57 headquarters. He claims that he um
03:02 

03:02 worked to end seven wars. So now he's
03:04 

03:04 saying he's ended eight wars u but
03:07 

03:07 without any help from the United
03:09 

03:09 Nations. So we're not going to watch his
03:11 

03:11 speech
03:13 

03:13 and what I'm going to do instead is
03:15 

03:15 welcome you as a as a diplomat uh coming
03:19 

03:19 into the United Nations. And there's a
03:21 

03:21 view of the Hudson River in Manhattan.
03:24 

03:24 I'm hoping to do a short supplementary
03:27 

03:27 video which introduces you to the the
03:30 

03:30 location of the UN in Manhattan and to
03:34 

03:34 the other sites around it with um a
03:37 

03:37 person who actually knows uh New York
03:40 

03:40 City extremely well. So, we're going to
03:41 

03:41 be doing that next week when I come back
03:44 

03:44 from Ottawa.
03:48 

03:48 The UN General Assembly is very
03:50 

03:50 evocative. You always know you're there
03:52 

03:52 because of the green everywhere, the
03:54 

03:54 green carpets. And this is the general
03:56 

03:56 assembly.
03:59 

03:59 And this is the front of the UN. I took
04:01 

04:01 these pictures of peacekeepers wearing
04:03 

04:03 the classic blue beret or they wear the
04:07 

04:07 blue helmet. And you can see the army
04:10 

04:10 and the air force, the navy.
04:13 

04:13 Uh here you can see more peacekeepers at
04:15 

04:15 the United Nations.
04:18 

04:18 And here you can see the UN general
04:21 

04:21 assembly from where the third floor
04:24 

04:24 where uh you sit to watch the debate and
04:27 

04:27 that's the front where the secretary
04:29 

04:29 general sits and you can see you can see
04:32 

04:32 live whoever is talking who has been the
04:35 

04:35 longest serving secretary general se Jen
04:38 

04:38 Utant he served for 10 years. So that's
04:42 

04:42 why it's important that we're talking to
04:43 

04:43 Peggy Mason because she served as an
04:46 

04:46 ambassador for uh many years, not quite
04:49 

04:49 10, but then since then she's been
04:51 

04:51 working on the UN. So I really can't get
04:53 

04:53 a better expert uh than Ambassador
04:56 

04:56 Mason.
04:58 

04:58 When I say get, I mean invite to our
04:60 

04:60 class. So she will be referring to the
05:03 

05:03 P5 which are five of the countries uh
05:06 

05:06 that are in the UN security council and
05:09 

05:09 they have permanent membership in that
05:11 

05:11 council which is a smaller group and
05:13 

05:13 there they are. China, France, the
05:15 

05:15 United Kingdom, the United States and
05:16 

05:16 Russia.
05:18 

05:18 Where can you find and talk to a P5
05:20 

05:20 diplomat? Perhaps uh Ambassador Mason
05:23 

05:23 will tell us a little bit about that and
05:25 

05:25 also about working with the Canadian
05:27 

05:27 delegation which she headed. So we will
05:30 

05:30 I hope hear about how to find Canadian
05:32 

05:32 delegates at the United Nations
05:36 

05:36 and then also uh this is the basement uh
05:39 

05:39 where they have different conference
05:41 

05:41 rooms. I have often held panels and
05:44 

05:44 participated in panels in conference
05:47 

05:47 rooms C and D in the basement and that
05:50 

05:50 is interesting because they don't have
05:52 

05:52 Zoom facilities. They don't have
05:54 

05:54 computers. You have to bring your own
05:56 

05:56 actually have to bring your own screens.
05:58 

05:58 Only lately did they get a screen. So,
06:01 

06:01 it's very primitive actually. It's like
06:03 

06:03 a high school from 60 years ago.
06:06 

06:06 You can also see diplomats at the UN
06:09 

06:09 cafeteria. Here's the American
06:11 

06:11 delegation uh talking in the cafeteria.
06:15 

06:15 And I'll show you another photo. There
06:17 

06:17 they are talking. And and you could, I
06:19 

06:19 suppose, go up to them, but they also
06:21 

06:21 for private meetings have their own
06:23 

06:23 dining rooms at the UN.
06:27 

06:27 Let me give you some more background
06:29 

06:29 about the P5. So the P5, the permanent
06:32 

06:32 members can veto any substant of any
06:35 

06:35 important matter that is presented to
06:37 

06:37 the UN security council. We'll talk more
06:40 

06:40 about the United Nations being a talk
06:42 

06:42 shop because many uh resolutions that
06:45 

06:45 are abstantive are are vetoed by the P5
06:48 

06:48 or one of the members of the P5. Any one
06:50 

06:50 of them can veto.
06:53 

06:53 In addition to the P5, there are 10
06:55 

06:55 non-permanent members of the UN Security
06:57 

06:57 Council that are elected on a two-year
06:60 

06:60 uh basis for two-year terms, and they're
07:02 

07:02 voted on by the UN General Assembly.
07:05 

07:05 Canada often tries to become a member of
07:08 

07:08 the rotating security council. We
07:10 

07:10 haven't been successful recently.
07:11 

07:11 Whenever we fail, the media call me and
07:14 

07:14 ask why. But the real explanation is
07:16 

07:16 that the UN General Assembly votes and
07:19 

07:19 so there's a lot of lobbying done and so
07:21 

07:21 on. Um, what languages do you need to
07:23 

07:23 operate to understand the debate? Well,
07:26 

07:26 six. There's six languages simultaneous
07:29 

07:29 translation into six languages at the
07:31 

07:31 UN. This is the uh kind of silence room,
07:36 

07:36 prayer room uh where at the UN it's not
07:39 

07:39 it's non non-nominational. It's not
07:41 

07:41 Christian or um Buddhist. It's uh a
07:44 

07:44 small room close to a a very famous
07:47 

07:47 stained glass by Chagal.
07:51 

07:51 Okay, where is the center of the UN? The
07:53 

07:53 center, the heart of the UN is as I
07:55 

07:55 mentioned this green room, the general
07:57 

07:57 assembly. And that's where all state
07:59 

07:59 parties, each country that is recognized
08:02 

08:02 is called a state party. And it can send
08:05 

08:05 representatives to participate in
08:07 

08:07 sessions. So here, this is each the
08:10 

08:10 countries are all in alphabetical order.
08:13 

08:13 Uh and then here up here on the third
08:15 

08:15 floor is civil society and
08:18 

08:18 representatives of NOS's. And then
08:20 

08:20 here's journalists and uh newspaper uh
08:24 

08:24 reporters. So they re vote and a
08:27 

08:27 resolution requires a majority to pass.
08:30 

08:30 We'll talk more about that later
08:32 

08:32 with a majority and so on. The United
08:34 

08:34 Nations was established in San Francisco
08:36 

08:36 in 1945 at the end of World War II and
08:39 

08:39 its headquarters was eventually moved
08:41 

08:41 from London, England, not London,
08:43 

08:43 Ontario to New York City. Where is it in
08:47 

08:47 New York City? That's I put a map here.
08:51 

08:51 So if you are familiar with New York
08:52 

08:52 City, I showed you the Hudson River
08:54 

08:54 there. Um and that's the UN the Trump
08:57 

08:57 Towers tower over Manhattan. Uh very
09:00 

09:00 very much much bigger than the than the
09:02 

09:02 United Nations and quite close by.
09:09 

09:09 Uh here's a picture of Jim First who was
09:12 

09:12 a very good writer uh who worked a lot
09:14 

09:14 at the United Nations along with another
09:17 

09:17 guy I know Randy Redell people who can
09:19 

09:19 write very very well and get people to
09:21 

09:21 agree on resolutions. Put him there
09:24 

09:24 because uh this was during a debate
09:26 

09:26 about um the oh this is the United
09:28 

09:28 Nations and see all the reporters
09:30 

09:30 they're waiting for diplomats to come
09:31 

09:31 out but usually diplomats don't speak to
09:33 

09:33 reporters. So then because I'm an
09:36 

09:36 academic and I don't mind speaking to
09:38 

09:38 reporters, you'd be siding I'd be like
09:40 

09:40 when there's breaking news, all these
09:42 

09:42 reporters ask you for interviews and so
09:44 

09:44 on because they're just looking for the
09:46 

09:46 story. The diplomats often can't say
09:48 

09:48 anything. Okay. What's the budget
09:50 

09:50 affecting the or the budget is
09:52 

09:52 approximately 1.2 billion which is not a
09:56 

09:56 lot of money.
09:59 

09:59 Okay. What are the issues affecting the
10:01 

10:01 budget? the budget. Um well, first of
10:02 

10:02 all, um the budget can be every country
10:05 

10:05 has is an has an assessment or a debt or
10:08 

10:08 a due and uh a lot of countries have
10:11 

10:11 unpaid contributions. I didn't invite a
10:14 

10:14 financial expert to speak to us about
10:16 

10:16 the UN's financial problems, but this
10:18 

10:18 these are very significant. So, I'm
10:20 

10:20 putting a bit here more than Peggy Mason
10:22 

10:22 will speak about. Uh some of my students
10:24 

10:24 have worked at the UN. And I remember
10:26 

10:26 one told me that the UN doesn't have
10:28 

10:28 enough money to even run the lights on
10:30 

10:30 the weekend, which I found hard to
10:31 

10:31 believe, but he was probably true.
10:36 

10:36 Okay, here's some um uh diplomats uh at
10:40 

10:40 on on the third floor. And then this is
10:43 

10:43 a negotiating room. Uh so the UN has the
10:46 

10:46 principal organs of the U sorry UN
10:49 

10:49 headquarters and that is as I mentioned
10:52 

10:52 the general assembly, the security
10:54 

10:54 council. Now, where is the ICJ? Let's
10:56 

10:56 say you want to work for the
10:57 

10:57 international court of justice. That has
10:59 

10:59 its seat in the H. The UN also has three
11:02 

11:02 additional subsidiary regional
11:04 

11:04 headquarters. Geneva, Vienna, and
11:06 

11:06 Nairobi. So, I imagine that Ambassador
11:08 

11:08 Mason was uh lived probably in in
11:12 

11:12 Vienna. Uh and then um Tariq Ralph lives
11:16 

11:16 in Geneva. So a lot of people find it
11:20 

11:20 very expensive in New York City
11:22 

11:22 including all the embassies and indeed
11:25 

11:25 uh the United Nations rents its land
11:27 

11:27 from the United States. So it's extr
11:29 

11:29 territorial.
11:32 

11:32 Who can vote at the UN today? Can
11:35 

11:35 individuals vote? No. Can significant
11:38 

11:38 people? Uh no. There's no parliamentary
11:40 

11:40 assembly of people. the only people or
11:42 

11:42 the only people that can vote are on be
11:44 

11:44 one vote per a country
11:47 

11:47 and there are some very very tiny
11:49 

11:49 countries that get to vote. Uh so under
11:51 

11:51 article 19 of the UN charter a member
11:54 

11:54 state that's in a rears meaning it has
11:56 

11:56 not paid its dues is supposed to not be
11:58 

11:58 able to vote but that is not imposed in
12:01 

12:01 fact the United States has not paid its
12:03 

12:03 dues in years and years and years and
12:05 

12:05 yet it still gets to vote and exert a
12:08 

12:08 veto. Uh so
12:10 

12:10 I think the best way to learn about the
12:13 

12:13 UN is to read this handbook, the GA
12:15 

12:15 handbook. It explains all the tiny rules
12:18 

12:18 of the UN and all the important ones and
12:20 

12:20 I highly recommend reading it even if
12:22 

12:22 you don't intend to work at the UN.
12:26 

12:26 For example, let's say the United
12:27 

12:27 Nations is undergoing the silence
12:29 

12:29 procedure. Well, if you're working at
12:31 

12:31 the UN, you don't know what that is
12:32 

12:32 unless you read the GA handbook. So the
12:35 

12:35 GA handbook explains that that's a phase
12:37 

12:37 at the end of the negotiations and I
12:39 

12:39 remember this because the section is
12:42 

12:42 sitting there and everyone is either
12:44 

12:44 calling their their capitals or trying
12:47 

12:47 to obtain final approval. Remember that
12:50 

12:50 the UN is in um Eastern Standard Time
12:53 

12:53 like us. So many capitals are are 10 or
12:55 

12:55 15 hours ahead or it's the weekend. So
12:58 

12:58 that can affect the discussions. But
13:01 

13:01 anyway, once the draft resolution, I'll
13:03 

13:03 teach you what an resolution is in a
13:05 

13:05 moment, is declared to be under the
13:07 

13:07 silence procedure, then um uh it is
13:11 

13:11 automatically approved by the SEC gen.
13:13 

13:13 So there's no voting. There's no um
13:15 

13:15 voting. I just put my hand up.
13:18 

13:18 Can you vote at the UN today? So here's
13:20 

13:20 the journalists waiting for everyone to
13:22 

13:22 come out and then are they voting in
13:25 

13:25 favor or not? Imagine the silence
13:28 

13:28 procedure like a kind of chat discussion
13:30 

13:30 where everyone says, "Okay, here's the
13:32 

13:32 draft resolution. Speak now or or hold
13:34 

13:34 your peace and then everyone goes silent
13:37 

13:37 and says nothing, no emojis, nothing."
13:39 

13:39 So, everyone collectively kind of
13:41 

13:41 silently agrees that the resolution
13:43 

13:43 should pass. That's how most of the
13:45 

13:45 resolutions are passed now. It's kind of
13:47 

13:47 a consensus. So, let's say you're
13:49 

13:49 working at the UN and you're looking
13:51 

13:51 around. You do not put your hand up and
13:53 

13:53 vote against something. you know, if
13:55 

13:55 everyone seems cool with it, then well,
13:58 

13:58 you know, you you probably should should
13:60 

13:60 be should be watching what's happening
14:01 

14:01 and and and listening to your capital.
14:04 

14:04 So, the silence procedure is basically
14:06 

14:06 diplomacy's answer to if nobody says
14:08 

14:08 anything, we're all good, right?
14:12 

14:12 Okay. I'm still on the topic of who can
14:14 

14:14 vote. Well, this little tiny little uh
14:16 

14:16 tiny little island, Kamoros, actually
14:19 

14:19 does not have voting rights because they
14:20 

14:20 have not paid up their dues, which are
14:23 

14:23 assessed. Very small amount of money,
14:25 

14:25 but they still have not paid it.
14:28 

14:28 So, here's Kamoros. They ever sit in
14:30 

14:30 alphabetical order. So, this way,
14:33 

14:33 Colombia, Camoros, um all the way up in
14:37 

14:37 English, an in English alphabetical
14:38 

14:38 order. So, Kamoros technically cannot
14:41 

14:41 vote at the UN. Canada sits close to
14:43 

14:43 these countries because we start with
14:45 

14:45 the letter C in English.
14:48 

14:48 Does Canada pay its dues? Well, I put
14:50 

14:50 quite a lot here about how much does
14:52 

14:52 Canada pay. Uh, Canada always pays its
14:55 

14:55 dues right away. We're one of the 35
14:57 

14:57 countries that pays in January. And this
15:00 

15:00 year we paid approximately 127 million.
15:04 

15:04 uh approximately well there's the amount
15:08 

15:08 in US dollars $87 million
15:11 

15:11 US okay now what what does this mean I
15:15 

15:15 just want to talk briefly because a lot
15:17 

15:17 of you might think that I'll round up
15:19 

15:19 the university registars um rounds up
15:23 

15:23 your grade book um and they do it in a
15:25 

15:25 certain way according to the second
15:26 

15:26 decibel so let's say you get 89.73 in
15:30 

15:30 the class in your final mark then the
15:32 

15:32 grade book rounds it to 89 9.7 which is
15:35 

15:35 then rounded up to 90. However, if you
15:38 

15:38 score 89.43
15:40 

15:40 then they go down because 3 is under
15:43 

15:43 five and four is under five and so you
15:45 

15:45 go to 89%. So the takeaway is that every
15:48 

15:48 fraction counts every percentage points
15:51 

15:51 counts in your grade. Um but and also
15:54 

15:54 for the United Nations obviously that's
15:56 

15:56 my point but as your professor I am not
15:58 

15:58 allowed to round the grades. Um, so if
16:01 

16:01 you ask me, a lot of students will write
16:02 

16:02 me, "Oh, I have an 89%." If I round you
16:05 

16:05 up, I have to round every single student
16:07 

16:07 in the class up by the same amount and
16:10 

16:10 then I'll have another group which will
16:12 

16:12 be complaining and and so on. So I'm not
16:14 

16:14 allowed to overwrite grades and that and
16:16 

16:16 in fact I'd be in the in the dean's
16:18 

16:18 office if I did that. So aim to uh
16:21 

16:21 secure every fraction of a percentage
16:23 

16:23 point just like the UN has to fight for
16:25 

16:25 its money.
16:27 

16:27 Okay. As I mentioned, Canada always pays
16:29 

16:29 its dues on time. Here's the UN
16:31 

16:31 cafeteria for civil society. And this is
16:34 

16:34 a good opportunity. Here you can see
16:35 

16:35 some Canadians seated here. They attend
16:38 

16:38 all these two people attend all the UN
16:42 

16:42 discussions and they issue a newsletter
16:44 

16:44 on on everything. So they they know what
16:46 

16:46 they're talking about. They're waiting
16:48 

16:48 out there. They follow the proceedings
16:50 

16:50 and they write a news letter called
16:52 

16:52 reaching critical will.
16:54 

16:54 they're um
16:57 

16:57 by the end of 2024 a total of 152 member
17:00 

17:00 states had paid their dues in full which
17:02 

17:02 is pretty impressive. There's all the
17:04 

17:04 countries like Canada and Germany, Korea
17:06 

17:06 and Germany uh and China are assessed
17:08 

17:08 hundreds of millions of dollars. But if
17:11 

17:11 we look again and I just checked the
17:12 

17:12 United States has not pay paid its dues
17:15 

17:15 for yet another year. And I I do think
17:17 

17:17 this is a travesty particularly because
17:19 

17:19 the US president um regularly speaks
17:22 

17:22 once a year usually at the United
17:24 

17:24 Nations.
17:26 

17:26 So here's the monthly uh statistics of
17:30 

17:30 the member states which paid in full
17:32 

17:32 over time 2001 2020 and you can see um
17:36 

17:36 that the United States has not paid in
17:38 

17:38 full for many many years.
17:42 

17:42 What are the countries that can vote at
17:44 

17:44 the UN? This is the list of the 193 UN
17:47 

17:47 member recognized states. That's not all
17:49 

17:49 the countries in the world. Uh for
17:51 

17:51 example, the Palestine Authority is not
17:54 

17:54 on this list because Palestine is not
17:56 

17:56 officially recognized as a state and and
17:59 

17:59 um and so it's not on this list. I might
18:02 

18:02 put the list on at the exam and ask you
18:05 

18:05 if a country is on it, but I'm not
18:07 

18:07 expecting you to memorize all the 193
18:10 

18:10 states.
18:12 

18:12 Okay, back to my theme. Is the United
18:14 

18:14 States paid up? The United States is
18:16 

18:16 supposed to be the biggest contributor
18:18 

18:18 to the UN's peacekeeping operations.
18:21 

18:21 Here's Boris Johnson and uh Donald Trump
18:24 

18:24 uh in the first administration and they
18:27 

18:27 did not pay the assessed dues 22 to 28%
18:31 

18:31 of the UN budget. The United States is
18:33 

18:33 still in a rears from 2014 on.
18:37 

18:37 It hasn't paid up. It argues it's
18:40 

18:40 assessed the most money, but that's
18:42 

18:42 because it has the largest GDP. So, for
18:44 

18:44 the fiscal years here, um, when
18:47 

18:47 President Biden gave a speech
18:48 

18:48 criticizing Russia in September 2022,
18:51 

18:51 and I put a link there, the United
18:53 

18:53 States was not paid up. President Trump
18:55 

18:55 made what was called his first explosive
18:58 

18:58 UN speech um, way back in 2016. The US
19:02 

19:02 was not paid up. And when President
19:04 

19:04 Obama delivered his last speech to the
19:05 

19:05 UN, it wasn't. So you can hear the
19:08 

19:08 different speeches if you want to click
19:09 

19:09 on that, but it's not on the exam, but
19:11 

19:11 it gives you a taste of what it is like
19:13 

19:13 to hear speakers at the UN.
19:16 

19:16 And here's President Joe Biden who gave
19:18 

19:18 uh two uh big speeches. The the latest
19:21 

19:21 one being very critical of Russia and
19:23 

19:23 the invasion of Ukraine. And then this
19:26 

19:26 one which was to the se this they call
19:28 

19:28 it the general assembly. So this is the
19:31 

19:31 77th general assembly in 2022. So if you
19:34 

19:34 want to see their remarks and read the
19:36 

19:36 transcript, go to white house.gov and
19:39 

19:39 then you can get their their the
19:40 

19:40 transcript. It's quicker to read that
19:42 

19:42 than listen to the entire speech.
19:46 

19:46 Okay. Is the United Nations
19:48 

19:48 representative? By that the United N is
19:50 

19:50 often criticized for its
19:51 

19:51 unrepresentative structure. And that's
19:54 

19:54 particularly because the UN Security
19:56 

19:56 Council reflects a postworld war II
19:59 

19:59 distribution of power that's outdated
20:01 

20:01 out out old style and has led to the
20:04 

20:04 exclusion of what are called emergent
20:06 

20:06 countries such as and I've just put in
20:08 

20:08 alphabetical order Germany, India,
20:10 

20:10 Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa because
20:12 

20:12 these are all countries that arguably
20:14 

20:14 should have a permanent seat. What
20:17 

20:17 countries should have a permanent seat
20:19 

20:19 making the P5, the P10 or the P20?
20:23 

20:23 That's an interesting debate
20:26 

20:26 and one could argue that Nigeria
20:29 

20:29 although it is a military uh regime
20:31 

20:31 should have as a country from Africa the
20:35 

20:35 a P8 seat. Uh so we will discuss this
20:38 

20:38 more in the remaining lessons. Okay,
20:41 

20:41 that's the end of this primer and I'll
20:43 

20:43 stop recording.
