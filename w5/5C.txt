00:01 Welcome everyone to uh five uh C or 5.3
00:07 

00:07 where we are preparing you to represent
00:10 

00:10 Canada or another country and how to
00:12 

00:12 write resolutions. So this is the back
00:14 

00:14 of the UN where only diplomats are
00:16 

00:16 allowed to go. There's a lot of
00:18 

00:18 sculptures
00:20 

00:20 and there's the Noah's arc. Uh you can
00:22 

00:22 see that we've done a bit of preliminary
00:25 

00:25 work on 5A and 5B. And now I want to
00:28 

00:28 just do a little bit more in-depth work
00:29 

00:29 before our guest speaker Leah Holla
00:33 

00:33 talks to us.
00:35 

00:35 When she's talking to us, I show this
00:37 

00:37 slide so you can see it now and study
00:40 

00:40 it. When she's talking to us, I show
00:43 

00:43 this slide which is her background and
00:45 

00:45 also it has the contact address for the
00:47 

00:47 United Nations Office for Disarmament
00:49 

00:49 Affairs.
00:51 

00:51 And I show this uh as a picture because
00:54 

00:54 it's very important. Very seldom do you
00:57 

00:57 see students knowing a UN resolution,
00:59 

00:59 profiting from the UN resolution,
01:02 

01:02 turning that into South Korea g the
01:05 

01:05 Republic of Korea giving $10 million for
01:08 

01:08 uh education and then there she is with
01:12 

01:12 other distinguished speakers as you can
01:14 

01:14 see at the UN launching this. So, I
01:16 

01:16 wanted to ask her to to to come and I
01:19 

01:19 was really pleased that she agreed to
01:21 

01:21 speak to our class here in in uh London,
01:24 

01:24 Ontario.
01:26 

01:26 Let me mention I showed her this and
01:28 

01:28 she'll talk a little bit about that. And
01:31 

01:31 I showed her this
01:33 

01:33 and I showed her that as a final slide
01:35 

01:35 and then we got to business talking
01:37 

01:37 about last week's consultations.
01:41 

01:41 And we also we talked a little bit about
01:43 

01:43 the numbers of youth that are working at
01:45 

01:45 the UN and that thus the dress code
01:47 

01:47 becoming more informal, people using
01:49 

01:49 their telephones everywhere now and and
01:51 

01:51 fewer restrictions.
01:54 

01:54 That leads me to talk about UN
01:56 

01:56 procedures for simulations, not just for
01:59 

01:59 the United Nations, but if you ever get
02:01 

02:01 the opportunity to participate in a UN
02:04 

02:04 sim uh UN a model UN, that is great. It
02:08 

02:08 doesn't have to be at the UN. it could
02:10 

02:10 be uh in a classroom. So for years I ran
02:13 

02:13 a UN assembly with 140 students that I
02:16 

02:16 taught and I'm very sad that I can't do
02:18 

02:18 that anymore because of the numbers that
02:21 

02:21 we have here online
02:24 

02:24 but English. Okay, so there's six
02:26 

02:26 languages at the UN and obviously at the
02:28 

02:28 UN simulation you tend to use English.
02:30 

02:30 Should you stand up and speak in French
02:32 

02:32 or Spanish? Of course you could do so.
02:35 

02:35 Uh what about credentials? Um, so most
02:39 

02:39 people who who speak at the UN here in
02:41 

02:41 the UN General Assembly are they're
02:43 

02:43 representing their country. They have to
02:45 

02:45 be very careful what they say in this
02:46 

02:46 room and they have to stick to the
02:49 

02:49 script. They cannot go off in a
02:51 

02:51 direction that they want to go off in
02:53 

02:53 and they have to call their country all
02:55 

02:55 the time even though there's a different
02:57 

02:57 time zone and just check that they can
02:59 

02:59 vote and so on. For example, Egypt has
03:03 

03:03 to always check even if it's a different
03:05 

03:05 time zone, but they're very very good.
03:08 

03:08 Uh the Egyptians have an excellent
03:11 

03:11 foreign service and their their officers
03:13 

03:13 are amazing and their ambassadors are
03:15 

03:15 amazing in terms of speaking in English.
03:17 

03:17 What about participating? A non-member
03:20 

03:20 state would be a country would would be
03:22 

03:22 Palestine. And Palestine officially at
03:24 

03:24 the United Nations does not yet have the
03:26 

03:26 same rights as those of full members
03:29 

03:29 like the 193 state parties.
03:33 

03:33 So those countries can attend but they
03:36 

03:36 cannot vote on substantive issues. They
03:39 

03:39 can vote on procedural issues. A quorum
03:42 

03:42 is a simple majority of the members that
03:45 

03:45 are there. So in the case of the UN
03:48 

03:48 general assembly um if there's 31 people
03:52 

03:52 there then the quorum is half of 31 half
03:56 

03:56 of 31 15.5 so 16 people plus one a
04:01 

04:01 quorum will be assumed to be present.
04:03 

04:03 Okay so you know later you'll learn
04:05 

04:05 about quorums but uh you know people
04:07 

04:07 always say oh is there enough people
04:08 

04:08 here? Do we have a quorum? Um what that
04:11 

04:11 means is are there enough people
04:12 

04:12 according to the constitution?
04:15 

04:15 Obviously delegates will show staff and
04:18 

04:18 in the UN model UN tend to not show they
04:22 

04:22 were very disre respectful often. Um
04:25 

04:25 you're not you are now allowed to use
04:27 

04:27 telephones. We used to say no and you
04:30 

04:30 should obviously turn off your cell
04:31 

04:31 phone. The first order of business is
04:33 

04:33 the agenda. So what's going to be on the
04:35 

04:35 agenda first? It's you think of it like
04:38 

04:38 Robert's rules of order. We have to
04:41 

04:41 agree on the agenda. The United Nations
04:43 

04:43 Conference on Disarmment has not agreed
04:45 

04:45 on agenda an agenda in over two decades.
04:48 

04:48 They can't even agree what they're going
04:50 

04:50 to talk about. So they don't even talk
04:51 

04:51 about what they're going to talk about
04:52 

04:52 because they can't agree on the agenda.
04:54 

04:54 All those diplomats in Geneva living the
04:56 

04:56 high life.
04:58 

04:58 Okay. Then the resolution that's first
05:01 

05:01 on the agenda, that's what we're going
05:02 

05:02 to be talking about today is the agenda.
05:04 

05:04 So, a motion to discuss the resolution
05:07 

05:07 on the agenda is put put on the table.
05:12 

05:12 There's the uh well, here this the day
05:15 

05:15 is the speaker. Um and it's usually the
05:19 

05:19 secretary general, but because the
05:20 

05:20 secretary general can't always be there,
05:22 

05:22 they rotate in. The House of Commons
05:25 

05:25 does the same. They rot in the speaker
05:27 

05:27 of the house, often sitting there
05:29 

05:29 falling asleep, a different person
05:31 

05:31 listening to everything. So they have to
05:33 

05:33 be their present. Um in simulations
05:37 

05:37 usually the motions that have the most
05:38 

05:38 number of signitories will be debated
05:40 

05:40 first. But this is not true at the UN.
05:42 

05:42 There they have a definite agenda and
05:45 

05:45 there's different motions that are to be
05:46 

05:46 debated. In a simulation they will have
05:49 

05:49 a for and against speakers list to
05:51 

05:51 debate each motion. But at the UN there
05:54 

05:54 is a speakers list for and against. Um
05:57 

05:57 but it's governed slightly differently
05:59 

05:59 in that you can you usually when you
06:00 

06:00 speak for a resolution you're in favor
06:02 

06:02 of it. You're not against it.
06:06 

06:06 Okay. Then there's always this thing
06:07 

06:07 about debate closing uh the debate. It's
06:10 

06:10 this the sec secretary general who feels
06:12 

06:12 the uh room the consensus in the room or
06:15 

06:15 that the motion is ready for a vote. So
06:18 

06:18 they're responsible for doing that. You
06:19 

06:19 can't just put up your hand and say I
06:21 

06:21 move that we close the debate. You can
06:24 

06:24 do that in regular meetings and that's a
06:26 

06:26 strategy and people will all go no no no
06:28 

06:28 you can't do that or they'll vote on it.
06:33 

06:33 Once the agenda has been determined
06:35 

06:35 there's an open speakers list and
06:37 

06:37 closure of debate. Um I put my my face
06:40 

06:40 here on purpose. You don't really need
06:42 

06:42 to know the closure of debate
06:45 

06:45 rules governing debate suspension.
06:47 

06:47 There's a lot here on on on suspension
06:50 

06:50 because in the old model UN's you use
06:52 

06:52 that a lot. But in the UN General
06:54 

06:54 Assembly today, pictured here, there's
06:56 

06:56 the UN with a with all the flags and
06:60 

07:00 here's the UN Security Council, not the
07:03 

07:03 UN General Assembly debating. Um, so
07:07 

07:07 postponement, twothirds of a vote to
07:09 

07:09 pass.
07:11 

07:11 So here's some more rules. And I don't
07:13 

07:13 want you to memorize these rules. I'm
07:15 

07:15 not going to ask you questions about
07:17 

07:17 right of reply, but speeches must be
07:19 

07:19 made in the third person for Afghanistan
07:22 

07:22 argues that the United States should not
07:25 

07:25 withdraw. The United States states, not
07:28 

07:28 I or we. Um,
07:32 

07:32 if you're not there, then you forfeit
07:34 

07:34 your time, which means you need they
07:36 

07:36 they they the speaker of the house in
07:39 

07:39 Canada has a um a whip, a person who
07:42 

07:42 whips everyone to get in on the right
07:45 

07:45 time. But here, the UN does not have
07:47 

07:47 that. They have they call you and they
07:49 

07:49 have speakers and intercoms.
07:53 

07:53 Privilege. You can rise on a point of
07:55 

07:55 personal privilege where you interrupt
07:57 

07:57 because something like the building
07:59 

07:59 there's a smoke alarm going on or uh the
08:02 

08:02 speaker is inaudible somehow. They have
08:04 

08:04 speakers and they have simultaneous
08:06 

08:06 translation and everybody here has a
08:10 

08:10 speaker in their ear, a microphone in
08:12 

08:12 their ear. A point of order where you
08:15 

08:15 indicate improper parliamentary
08:17 

08:17 procedure. Believe me, that doesn't
08:18 

08:18 happen at the UN. um points of
08:21 

08:21 parliamentary inquiry to ask a question
08:24 

08:24 regarding the rules of procedure. That's
08:25 

08:25 a stalling tactic and they won't allow
08:27 

08:27 you to do that at the UN, but that's a
08:29 

08:29 popular thing to do at simulations.
08:33 

08:33 Signitories. Um okay. So when when they
08:37 

08:37 start to vote, usually there's a draft,
08:39 

08:39 there's a roll call, and they publicize
08:42 

08:42 how many signitories they need to pass
08:45 

08:45 something. In a UN simulation, you can
08:49 

08:49 sign a draft resolution, but it's when
08:51 

08:51 you finally sign that it really counts.
08:55 

08:55 Let us learn to use to write a UN
08:58 

08:58 resolution. So, we're going to kind of
09:00 

09:00 talk about how to do so using uh my
09:03 

09:03 latest proposal published in the Globe
09:05 

09:05 and Mail on a made in Canada
09:07 

09:07 peacekeeping force
09:10 

09:10 in Canada. Uh so, it's a useful skill.
09:14 

09:14 um it would be along the 49th parallel.
09:17 

09:17 Anyway, to do this as a writer, you must
09:19 

09:19 understand the content. So, you cannot
09:21 

09:21 just put the information from a
09:24 

09:24 PowerPoint into chat and say, "Write a
09:27 

09:27 UN resolution." You need to understand
09:29 

09:29 the content. And I really want to
09:31 

09:31 emphasize with you that many of you are
09:34 

09:34 using AI to write letters and to write
09:37 

09:37 resolutions and to write all sorts of
09:39 

09:39 things. But you still need to understand
09:41 

09:41 the content so that you can engage with
09:44 

09:44 other delegations and change the
09:45 

09:45 wording. Every nuance is important.
09:48 

09:48 Every word, every sentence, you wouldn't
09:50 

09:50 believe how important that is.
09:54 

09:54 Uh so here's my latest proposal, a bold
09:57 

09:57 proposal that um well actually I think
09:60 

09:60 the Globe Mail said a innovative
10:02 

10:02 proposal but they published it and I'm
10:04 

10:04 getting a lot of calls. How can Canada
10:06 

10:06 defend itself Toronto Star today and
10:09 

10:09 last week on and on they're very
10:11 

10:11 concerned about defending ourselves
10:14 

10:14 and Belgium and different places.
10:16 

10:16 Anyway, so it's the longest undefended
10:19 

10:19 world boundary. Uh and then we have an
10:22 

10:22 economic statement
10:24 

10:24 where we need to figure out how to
10:26 

10:26 distribute um these sorts of things. Um
10:38 

10:38 okay. Um
10:40 

10:40 okay. So here I'm calling for the
10:42 

10:42 establish of a made in Canada
10:43 

10:43 peacekeeping force. You can immediately
10:45 

10:45 see the problems with all that. You've
10:46 

10:46 taken some peacekeeping with me already.
10:49 

10:49 But I'm saying it would be neutral.
10:50 

10:50 Would it be passed at the UN? Readers
10:52 

10:52 don't even think about that. They're
10:54 

10:54 they're just thinking that I've lost my
10:56 

10:56 mind. But I'm saying here that it would
10:58 

10:58 foster global cooperation and innovation
11:04 

11:04 and it would draw inspiration. So here
11:06 

11:06 what I'm saying is we would actually
11:08 

11:08 draw from Canadians. Uh we wouldn't draw
11:11 

11:11 from the global south. Most UN
11:13 

11:13 peacekeeping operations are cheaper
11:15 

11:15 because those combat capable soldiers
11:18 

11:18 are trained and they are paid very
11:20 

11:20 little by their host countries. So let's
11:22 

11:22 say these people are from the
11:23 

11:23 Bangladesh. Bangladesh has very cheap
11:25 

11:25 peacekeepers. But I'm saying Canada
11:27 

11:27 would would do so using people from
11:30 

11:30 local communities. So immediately red
11:32 

11:32 flag because you know that's not going
11:34 

11:34 to pass at the UN.
11:38 

11:38 Okay. So then I go on the the soldiers
11:40 

11:40 trained in trained somehow peacekeeping
11:42 

11:42 training international stewardship. Of
11:45 

11:45 course they would not dawn the UN's blue
11:47 

11:47 helmets iconic blue helmets because
11:50 

11:50 there would be a security council veto.
11:52 

11:52 So we know that such an initiative would
11:55 

11:55 be vetoed by the United States and
11:59 

11:59 probably Russia and China because it
12:01 

12:01 would have implications for their own uh
12:04 

12:04 territorial conquests. it would be uh it
12:07 

12:07 would be vetoed by China because of
12:09 

12:09 China's interests with Taiwan and so
12:12 

12:12 they don't want a peacekeeping force in
12:14 

12:14 in Taiwan. Similarly, the US would veto
12:17 

12:17 it.
12:20 

12:20 So, keeping that that in mind, I veer
12:23 

12:23 off into how this could engage young
12:25 

12:25 people and perhaps even the United
12:27 

12:27 States. People from the United States
12:30 

12:30 might come over and be interested in
12:33 

12:33 universal healthcare, progressive
12:35 

12:35 values. There I go on and on.
12:38 

12:38 And this is the kicker because, of
12:40 

12:40 course, many people would love to have a
12:42 

12:42 one-year visa program. And if that would
12:44 

12:44 be a way to draw them in from Ivy League
12:48 

12:48 schools or from countries that have lots
12:51 

12:51 of money that would foster cultural
12:54 

12:54 exchange and mutual learning. You're
12:55 

12:55 already guessing that I'm advocating for
12:58 

12:58 this based on a Katimovic program that
13:01 

13:01 was very successful way back then where
13:04 

13:04 we trained people, youth to pro to
13:07 

13:07 travel across Canada and serve as
13:09 

13:09 peacekeepers, border guards,
13:10 

13:10 interpreters, and they even um cleared
13:13 

13:13 trails in national parks.
13:17 

13:17 So here I'm getting more, you know,
13:19 

13:19 enthusiastic about the where this force
13:21 

13:21 would be, which would be obviously along
13:24 

13:24 the 49th parallel. Uh, and also would it
13:28 

13:28 be in Alberta? I I write here I I
13:31 

13:31 skipped Alberta because I wasn't sure
13:33 

13:33 Alberta would agree and went straight to
13:36 

13:36 British Columbia's old growth forests
13:38 

13:38 here and argued that they would be in
13:41 

13:41 the prairies. So see how you can kind of
13:42 

13:42 get away with that. And they might study
13:45 

13:45 languages such as Spanish, promoting
13:47 

13:47 cross-cultural understanding and
13:50 

13:50 enhancing North America's ability. So
13:52 

13:52 it's still not going to pass at the UN,
13:54 

13:54 everyone. It has no hope of passing at
13:57 

13:57 the UN.
13:60 

13:60 A lot of people are used to talking
14:01 

14:01 about AI now, just trying to get
14:02 

14:02 everything through with AI and talking
14:04 

14:04 about drones and so on. So I put that in
14:07 

14:07 about drones.
14:09 

14:09 We are spending money on drones and
14:12 

14:12 drones are very much talked about. Last
14:14 

14:14 week at the global affairs Canada we
14:15 

14:15 spent considerable amount of time
14:17 

14:17 talking about drones and obviously we
14:21 

14:21 would have RCMP and defense personnel.
14:24 

14:24 They would be helping the peacekeepers.
14:27 

14:27 They would all be trained in
14:29 

14:29 deescalation diplomacy and so on. So you
14:31 

14:31 can see this is not going to pass. It's
14:33 

14:33 not going to pass in the House of
14:34 

14:34 Parliament either. it would be opposed
14:36 

14:36 by the Conservatives.
14:39 

14:39 I think the li the Liberals might pass
14:42 

14:42 it um eventually and the Greens and the
14:45 

14:45 NDP, but I was at the LA House of
14:48 

14:48 Parliament last week and visited it on
14:50 

14:50 Monday and they couldn't even agree on
14:54 

14:54 the criminal um there's a criminal uh
14:58 

14:58 legislation that was going through this.
14:59 

14:59 I watched it for a while for about an
15:02 

15:02 hour and a half. Uh, so they couldn't
15:04 

15:04 agree on criminal prosecutions. So here
15:07 

15:07 I'm writing about fentanel. So basically
15:09 

15:09 you're getting the impression that this
15:10 

15:10 is not going to happen.
15:12 

15:12 Um, what am I saying here? Oh, our
15:14 

15:14 shared commitment. This is just rhetoric
15:17 

15:17 rhetoric
15:19 

15:19 by me. And then I'm just talking about
15:22 

15:22 this. So this is the world's longest uh
15:25 

15:25 symbol of peacekeeping coexistence
15:27 

15:27 because we have this border. So don't
15:29 

15:29 ever forget students that this is the
15:31 

15:31 border. The United States owns this
15:33 

15:33 territory, Alaska, and this territory.
15:37 

15:37 Don't forget that. And that's what makes
15:39 

15:39 this the longest border stretching over
15:41 

15:41 here.
15:42 

15:42 Maintaining the status quo is no longer
15:44 

15:44 sufficient and people are worried. But
15:46 

15:46 I'm being polite.
15:49 

15:49 A team Canada initiative supported by
15:52 

15:52 cutting edge toler would serve as a
15:54 

15:54 powerful symbol. So, could we get that
15:57 

15:57 passed at the UN with a made in Canada?
16:00 

16:00 No. You You could write the best
16:02 

16:02 resolution in the world and it's not
16:05 

16:05 going to get passed.
16:07 

16:07 Guarding a legacy of peace. Um well,
16:10 

16:10 yes. So, we do need to reinforce our
16:13 

16:13 reputation as a peacekeeping leader.
16:15 

16:15 We're not we're not de demonstrating
16:17 

16:17 leadership at the UN anymore on that.
16:21 

16:21 as the world faces an increasingly
16:23 

16:23 uncertain future. Do you like my my
16:25 

16:25 pictures here? Uh, with millions of
16:27 

16:27 people dying, so I didn't put any people
16:30 

16:30 dying in Gaza. I can't upset you. I
16:33 

16:33 would have to put a disclaimer on here.
16:35 

16:35 I didn't put any people dying in
16:36 

16:36 Cheschna, uh, in in Israel, in Ukraine,
16:39 

16:39 possibly Taiwan. Look at these benign
16:42 

16:42 shots. But there we are, leading by
16:47 

16:47 example. And then I of course resort to
16:49 

16:49 the past
16:51 

16:51 which I did today for the Toronto Star.
16:52 

16:52 I started talking about the history of
16:54 

16:54 prisonian internationalism and
16:56 

16:56 peacekeeping training centers and how we
16:58 

16:58 need to move forward into a world of
17:01 

17:01 middle powers cooperating in the wake of
17:03 

17:03 Davos toward more and more cooperation
17:07 

17:07 and middle powermanship.
17:09 

17:09 leading by example rather than pouring
17:11 

17:11 billions and literally they're talking
17:14 

17:14 about the the US budget is now nearly1
17:16 

17:16 trillion dollars every year and the
17:19 

17:19 world spends I think it's I'll have to
17:22 

17:22 look that up so I don't say it right now
17:23 

17:23 but essentially right now I'll talk
17:25 

17:25 about it in a few weeks um we this would
17:29 

17:29 be something that we could invest in
17:30 

17:30 instead of let's say space defense
17:36 

17:36 we talked a lot last week about the
17:38 

17:38 golden dome and that concept cept I I
17:41 

17:41 was quite surprised how much we talked
17:42 

17:42 about it. This was the consultation with
17:44 

17:44 Global Affairs Canada. Most importantly
17:47 

17:47 would reaffirm the shared values of
17:48 

17:48 peace and cooperation that have long
17:50 

17:50 defined the Canada US defense
17:52 

17:52 relationship.
17:55 

17:55 Leading by example. So now is the time
17:56 

17:56 to act in time. Okay. To in here we are.
18:00 

18:00 Um this is changing even today. A
18:03 

18:03 reporter called me today or no a
18:05 

18:05 television station. and they wanted to
18:06 

18:06 talk about um new attacks here on
18:10 

18:10 Zapritz by by Russia despite the
18:12 

18:12 ceasefire and so on. And then I write
18:15 

18:15 here instead of waiting for hypothetical
18:17 

18:17 situations such as an attempt by
18:19 

18:19 President Trump to seize Canada or to
18:21 

18:21 annex the country, we must take
18:23 

18:23 proactive steps,
18:27 

18:27 leading by example.
18:29 

18:29 Um,
18:31 

18:31 yeah. So, here I'm using the word great
18:33 

18:33 powers published in the Globe and Mail
18:35 

18:35 and they kept the G and the P, which is
18:38 

18:38 a new world that we're entered.
18:42 

18:42 Okay. So, how to write a resolution at
18:44 

18:44 the UN. I showed you the pictures here
18:47 

18:47 at the front of the UN and the UN
18:48 

18:48 assembly. And when the UN was created,
18:50 

18:50 remember in 1945, there were only 51
18:53 

18:53 member states that didn't include the
18:54 

18:54 whole world. Now, it does. And so there
18:57 

18:57 are 193 right now. Roughly 80% of the
19:01 

19:01 general assembly resolutions are adopted
19:02 

19:02 by consensus. That is without taking a
19:04 

19:04 vote. They don't put their hands up.
19:06 

19:06 They just agree.
19:09 

19:09 Let me talk about that. So this whole
19:11 

19:11 old way of having a majority 50% plus
19:15 

19:15 one that was very popular in UN
19:17 

19:17 simulations because you could win or
19:18 

19:18 lose and simply by one vote after a
19:21 

19:21 majority. And people didn't care about
19:23 

19:23 or try to understand what Mexico
19:25 

19:25 thought. people didn't think about uh
19:27 

19:27 what Syria thought and so on. But now
19:29 

19:29 the UN runs by consensus more and
19:32 

19:32 delegates are much more concerned about
19:34 

19:34 the viewpoint of others and they want
19:37 

19:37 compromise. They take they try because
19:40 

19:40 you have to have a consensus in order to
19:42 

19:42 implement this. So you might as well try
19:44 

19:44 and get it at the UN.
19:47 

19:47 Given the dramatic increase in member
19:49 

19:49 states over time, reaching consensus is
19:53 

19:53 vital. These are some um behind
19:54 

19:54 the-scenes photos where the diplomats
19:57 

19:57 work. These are the committees and so
19:58 

19:58 on. First committee and so on. They meet
20:01 

20:01 in these kind of smaller rooms. Because
20:03 

20:03 the general assembly's resolutions are
20:05 

20:05 recommendations and not legally binding
20:07 

20:07 on member states, reaching consensus has
20:10 

20:10 evolved as a way to ensure the widest
20:13 

20:13 possible implementation of general
20:15 

20:15 assembly decisions.
20:19 

20:19 In model UN simulations they do not
20:21 

20:21 consider implementation and so they tend
20:24 

20:24 to argue and be opposed. Most
20:26 

20:26 resolutions at model UN conferences are
20:28 

20:28 adopted by a vote. But if we are now
20:32 

20:32 trying to teach consensus and you cannot
20:34 

20:34 truly understand the UN as an
20:36 

20:36 institution without understanding that
20:38 

20:38 it has evolved toward trying to reach
20:40 

20:40 consensus just as NATO tries to reach
20:43 

20:43 consensus.
20:45 

20:45 How do you format your resolution? uh AI
20:48 

20:48 will do this for you now. You can put it
20:50 

20:50 in and just test it and you'll see that
20:52 

20:52 it will write anything that you write as
20:54 

20:54 a resolution marginalizing it and doing
20:57 

20:57 the wording and doing the wording. So
20:60 

20:60 practice with AI and do some draft
21:03 

21:03 resolutions.
21:06 

21:06 Format your resolution so that uh
21:08 

21:08 resolution begins with the general
21:10 

21:10 assembly and then there are what are
21:12 

21:12 called parameulatory phrases that
21:15 

21:15 describe the problem being addressed and
21:17 

21:17 explain it. So it recalls it explains
21:20 

21:20 the purpose of the resolution and that
21:23 

21:23 all offers support for the operative
21:25 

21:25 what is the UN going to do. So the
21:27 

21:27 operative operation clauses that follow
21:31 

21:31 each clause in the preamble begins with
21:34 

21:34 an underlined word and ends with a comma
21:36 

21:36 and chat will do that all for you. Now
21:39 

21:39 operative clauses are numbered and state
21:41 

21:41 the action to be taken by the body.
21:44 

21:44 These clauses all begin with strong
21:46 

21:46 words, strong present tense words that
21:49 

21:49 are strong. Uh so those are followed by
21:52 

21:52 a semicolon except for the last which
21:54 

21:54 ends with a period. There should be no
21:56 

21:56 periods in the body of the resolution.
21:58 

21:58 Well, put your resolution into AI and
22:01 

22:01 make sure that it does it properly.
22:04 

22:04 Here are some delegates are about to re
22:06 

22:06 I was actually here so I took the photo.
22:07 

22:07 You're not and you can see the countries
22:10 

22:10 are all lined up there alphabetically.
22:12 

22:12 There's China and they're about to
22:14 

22:14 receive the draft document in 2010.
22:17 

22:17 Um, so you'll hear the guest speaker
22:19 

22:19 referred to another Security Council
22:21 

22:21 resolution 2150. And that's how they run
22:24 

22:24 off your lips. you just you just know
22:26 

22:26 all the numbers. It's crazy. Uh so this
22:29 

22:29 is some sample resolutions here um that
22:33 

22:33 I want to show you. So there you see the
22:35 

22:35 title of the resolution and don't don't
22:38 

22:38 copy your resolutions from previous
22:40 

22:40 resolutions and then hand them in as if
22:43 

22:43 they're new. Don't do that, but learn
22:45 

22:45 from them. So there's the um
22:48 

22:48 parameulatory phrases recalling and
22:51 

22:51 concern. So there's nothing operative
22:52 

22:52 there.
22:55 

22:55 noting uh recognizing. So this
22:59 

22:59 resolution goes on for pages uh two more
23:01 

23:01 pages and then it concludes us with its
23:04 

23:04 operative clauses. So what are they?
23:07 

23:07 Antonio Gutierrez is looking straight
23:09 

23:09 for those operative clauses. So here you
23:12 

23:12 can see everyone's flipping to the end
23:14 

23:14 and the tension is high because they're
23:16 

23:16 looking and they're suddenly discovering
23:18 

23:18 that there's 64 operative clauses which
23:21 

23:21 is unprecedented in 2010. It's
23:24 

23:24 unbelievable really that they'd agreed
23:26 

23:26 on 64 operative clauses
23:30 

23:30 remember. Uh so anyway, here it is. This
23:33 

23:33 is another sample resolution. And here
23:36 

23:36 these were written by my students and
23:39 

23:39 they only had five sponsors. So in my UN
23:43 

23:43 simulation, it would not be we would not
23:45 

23:45 discuss it. You have to have consensus
23:47 

23:47 and this is not enough consensus
23:50 

23:50 uh to get this at that time. Now of
23:53 

23:53 course there's 99 countries that have
23:54 

23:54 signed the TPNW and they've actually
23:57 

23:57 agreed to a new treaty that's very
23:59 

23:59 similar to this. So that's interesting.
24:00 

24:00 in 99 countries, the TPNW.
24:05 

24:05 So, this is back in 2010. They're
24:06 

24:06 phoning back to their capitals right
24:08 

24:08 there and they're getting information
24:11 

24:11 about what they should do and if they
24:12 

24:12 should proceed.
24:16 

24:16 Here's some resolutions from previous
24:17 

24:17 years in my classroom uh where they
24:20 

24:20 couldn't even get, you know, be it
24:22 

24:22 resolved that the UN declare war on
24:24 

24:24 Iran. uh that was in the past and now of
24:27 

24:27 course the United States government is
24:30 

24:30 and Israel are considering uh bombing
24:32 

24:32 Iran to for regime change and that's a
24:36 

24:36 big threat. So here's their that was the
24:38 

24:38 resolution, but it didn't get anywhere.
24:41 

24:41 Sample resolutions from my model at
24:43 

24:43 UN's. This one was interesting cuz the
24:45 

24:45 student that sponsored it was able to
24:48 

24:48 obtain seven sponsors and then it just
24:50 

24:50 gradually rose in our discussion and
24:53 

24:53 they finally it passed. This is before
24:56 

24:56 co um so the two co-signatorries
25:00 

25:00 Kazakhstan and Kenya must agree with the
25:02 

25:02 resolution at the beginning. This is in
25:04 

25:04 a UN simulation typically.
25:08 

25:08 Here you can see people phoning. Very
25:10 

25:10 exciting. And a resolution from Canada
25:12 

25:12 on peacekeeping. What might they think
25:14 

25:14 basically would never even get into this
25:16 

25:16 room. It will never get to the United
25:18 

25:18 Nations. I brought it up to show you
25:20 

25:20 that some some ideas are domestic
25:23 

25:23 proposals and ideas meant to ferment
25:26 

25:26 debate and discussion uh in the wake of
25:30 

25:30 threats to annex Canada and that Canada
25:33 

25:33 would become a 51st state.
25:38 

25:38 Can you use these paramulatory phrases?
25:40 

25:40 So these are some sample ones. There's
25:42 

25:42 many. I just let you don't have to
25:44 

25:44 memorize those. Please don't memorize
25:45 

25:45 them. welcoming, taking into account,
25:49 

25:49 keeping in mind.
25:52 

25:52 And here are the operative clauses. Call
25:55 

25:55 upon, designate, express, express hope,
25:58 

25:58 further, invite. See how general they
26:01 

26:01 are and how gentle they are. It's not
26:03 

26:03 demand.
26:05 

26:05 UN General Assembly sample resolutions
26:08 

26:08 from my classroom here. Uh we're sitting
26:11 

26:11 at the UN on the third floor
26:14 

26:14 here. Um, consensus important. So, I
26:16 

26:16 mentioned this that all member states
26:19 

26:19 could agree to a resolution without
26:21 

26:21 taking a vote. If they agree on the
26:23 

26:23 text, but there's just one member state,
26:25 

26:25 Iran or Israel or but not Palestine
26:28 

26:28 because it can't vote uh that requests a
26:30 

26:30 vote, then consensus is not reached. Um,
26:33 

26:33 and I've seen that actually at the UN
26:36 

26:36 with the Palestine standing outside on
26:38 

26:38 the newsroom arguing against a
26:41 

26:41 resolution.
26:44 

26:44 Here is the happy uh writers,
26:48 

26:48 particularly Randy Redell, uh, who
26:50 

26:50 managed to reach a consensus among 193
26:53 

26:53 countries on the 2010 resolution and
26:57 

26:57 that was passed with the 64 planks, the
26:59 

26:59 64 operative clauses. So, he's looking
27:02 

27:02 very happy. And I took this picture of
27:03 

27:03 him cuz he should be happy.
27:06 

27:06 And here's some more happy people back
27:08 

27:08 in 2010. And I
27:12 

27:12 there's Jim First who also wrote many
27:15 

27:15 reports that fed into that.
27:18 

27:18 And then finally, uh, Jonathan Granoff,
27:21 

27:21 who you heard from in my other class,
27:23 

27:23 uh, speaking, the the president of the
27:25 

27:25 Global Security Institute, and Alice
27:27 

27:27 Slater, who is a New York City um, civil
27:31 

27:31 society representative, smiling because
27:33 

27:33 it was adopted by consensus. You would
27:36 

27:36 not get consensus on my resolution for a
27:38 

27:38 made in Canada peacekeeping force, but
27:40 

27:40 it's worth me introducing to you as a
27:43 

27:43 way to teach you about consensus. Thank
27:46 

27:46 you for listening today.
