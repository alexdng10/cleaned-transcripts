0:00
uh Canada US
0:02
relations during the Biden and the Trump
0:05
Administration so you'll probably
0:06
remember January 6
0:08
2021 when uh the uh Capitol Hill
0:12
insurgents invaded the house of well
0:16
actually the entire Washington almost
0:17
house of Congress and so on and the the
0:20
military deployed and the date is called
0:22
January 6
0:24
2021 so the US Congress immediately
0:27
resumed the election certification on
0:30
that date and uh although there was this
0:33
this prot Trump mob and there's
0:35
President Joe elect Joe Biden he made a
0:38
speech very stirring very lengthy about
0:41
domestic terrorists and then later we
0:44
heard many assertions by President
0:46
outgoing president Trump that the
0:48
election had been
0:50
stolen within a few hours Twitter uh
0:54
locked Trump's account uh it has since
0:56
been reopened uh they said that he was
0:59
inciting violence and Trump would be
1:02
banned obviously that did not
1:05
happen and stunned North Americans then
1:08
saw firsthand evidence that the US
1:10
president could be perhaps uh unhinged
1:14
meaning a little bit uh crazy irrational
1:18
irresponsible so later he was impeached
1:20
and then before he left office uh where
1:24
this is a class in Canada abroad uh this
1:27
guy who was very supportive of trump
1:29
back then and asked whether Trump could
1:31
be trusted not to incite further
1:33
Insurrection so that was a radio show
1:36
everyone Canadians that her thought that
1:38
the president's failure to condemn the
1:40
supporters was a dereliction of his duty
1:43
to to protect the US
1:46
Constitution still uh president Trump's
1:49
finger former president Trum Trump's
1:52
finger remains on the nuclear trigger
1:54
now and uh while literally thousands of
1:57
intercontinental ballistic missiles are
1:59
poting at hundreds of Russian cities and
2:01
vice versa so he's now at the Apex of
2:04
power in
2:06
202 five and he could still um order a a
2:11
nuclear strike on
2:13
Russia so the question is do you think
2:16
president Trump could order a nuclear
2:18
strike on Russia we do not know but guy
2:20
Roberts seemed to think not as Roberts
2:23
put it unless deterant failed and Russia
2:26
or China strikes the United States then
2:27
the US would retaliate because
2:29
deterrence have failed but guy Roberts
2:32
has always had a great deal of faith and
2:33
you you can see that last week in the in
2:36
the discussion he has a great deal of
2:38
faith in deterrence
2:40
working so we might expect uh threats
2:43
from uh Kim Jong-un and we talked about
2:45
that last week if he thought his power
2:48
would be usurped or lost and we have
2:51
heard his threats to uh demolish the
2:53
United States with missiles
2:56
before but the opposite argument and Guy
2:59
Robert remember he recommended that you
3:01
read the day after and a lot of people
3:03
will say oh you should watch the movie
3:04
Doctor Strange Love and so on but really
3:07
the nuclear command and control system
3:08
claims that it has many many blocks and
3:11
you'll hear Tariq Ralph uh say many
3:13
processes and and procedures that would
3:15
make sure that it was not made by a
3:17
single uh person a single de decision so
3:21
it would somehow prevent a lunatic
3:25
president nevertheless president Trump
3:27
has actually undermined deterrence
3:29
strategy because he presents himself as
3:31
unreasonable and irrational and
3:33
deterrence is based on uh rationality
3:36
now other people argue it's based on
3:37
irrationality you have to seem in insane
3:39
Herman Khan made that argument for
3:42
deterrence to succeed you have to you
3:44
have to seem irrational um president
3:47
Trump might have to appear irrational
3:49
for it to work so what is deterrence I
3:52
realize that um I haven't given you a
3:55
definition uh I put a picture here of of
3:58
Henry kisson during he didn't actually
4:00
have a definition either in his books
4:02
about deterrence but just straight from
4:04
the Oxford dictionary it's the action of
4:08
discouraging something through
4:10
instilling doubt or fear of the
4:12
consequences and there's some sentences
4:14
here uh where we use deterrence so guy
4:17
Roberts believes in the tenants of
4:19
deterrence he talks about extended
4:22
deterrence uh last week and then he
4:25
argues I think that nuclear deterrence I
4:28
argue it has to be perfect or close to
4:30
perfect and if it fails cat catastrophe
4:34
will result whereas he would argue that
4:37
um we need more deterrence especially in
4:39
the cyber warfare uh world that we're
4:42
going into so moving quickly along you
4:44
can study that at your own
4:46
time deterrence cannot survive as a
4:49
credible strategy if we perceive that
4:51
its ex executors are irrational and
4:55
incapable of weighing cost benefit R uh
4:58
uh rationality uh choices so this was
5:01
admirably pointed out by an author from
5:05
Rand a famous Think Tank where he
5:07
pointed out and there's so many books on
5:09
deterrence this is just one of them that
5:11
it's the perceptions that count it's
5:14
those perceptions not the actual
5:16
objective conditions that are important
5:18
so perceptions are the dominant variable
5:20
as he put it so I want you to think
5:23
about that in the context of President
5:25
Trump because it does seem that often he
5:28
is illogical and and more narcissistic
5:31
and more self-focused and so the
5:33
travesty of of democracy right now is
5:36
that we're relying upon deterrence as a
5:39
credible strategy and yet it's based on
5:41
either rationality or irrationality and
5:44
it's it's
5:47
unclear moving on uh so we haven't
5:49
talked a lot about the new Ban Treaty
5:52
the prohibition treaty or What's called
5:54
the tpnw the treaty on the prohibition
5:57
of nuclear weapons and our guest speaker
5:59
this week refers very quickly to the
6:01
tpnw very strong advocate of the tpnw uh
6:05
in Geneva and so I asked him to come in
6:08
I'll explain who he is in in in the next
6:10
uh two subl lessons slowly but the
6:13
non-nuclear countries are resoundingly a
6:16
majority of them at the UN General
6:18
Assembly are supporting this
6:20
treaty so they're asking themselves what
6:23
could happen if to the globe to the
6:25
Earth if there was a limited nuclear war
6:28
so they bring up examp not just of India
6:30
and Pakistan but of nuclear winter if
6:33
100 tactical nuclear weapons were used
6:35
and that is just a small small
6:38
percentage of the global number of
6:40
nuclear weapons that we learned about so
6:42
the pandemic would be like as I put here
6:44
romp in the park compared to the number
6:46
of
6:48
deaths so you heard guy Roberts talk
6:50
about that and afterwards after we got
6:52
off the taping he he actually said to me
6:54
that he thought a nuclear winter would
6:56
be good because it would cope with the
6:58
effects of a nuclear uh sorry nuclear
7:00
winter would would help to cool down the
7:02
Earth because of um climate change where
7:05
the Earth is getting warmer so we talked
7:07
about that there's no evidence um either
7:10
way no one really knows what would
7:12
happen but it was interesting idea that
7:14
he didn't put forward on the tape so
7:16
there're the leaders at NATO
7:18
headquarters where guy was the head of
7:20
the nuclear Planning Group and all the
7:22
Diplomatic staff there for 10 years uh
7:25
so the NATO allies reject any attempt to
7:28
delegitimize nuclear deterr they are all
7:30
strong Advocates of
7:33
deterrence NATO has paned meaning
7:36
criticized absolutely refuses to join
7:38
the tpnw and will not even send
7:41
observers so only lately have they
7:42
started to send NATO allies as uh
7:45
observers there's Yen stoltenberg he is
7:48
no longer the UN Secretary General he's
7:50
the former Chief the former Secretary
7:53
General he repeatedly warned uh that the
7:55
tpnw would uh undermine Global disarming
7:59
efforts because he argues that the npt
8:01
is
8:03
strong so Secretary General uh Antonio
8:06
GES said in October 2021 that any use of
8:10
nuclear weapons would have catastrophic
8:12
humanitarian consequences so that's the
8:14
vocabulary that we use now gueras uses
8:17
and the UN
8:18
uses catastrophe and they argue that the
8:21
new treaty that the tpnw is a meaningful
8:24
commitment toward the elimination the
8:26
abolition of nuclear weapons which they
8:29
say is is the un's highest priority the
8:31
number one
8:33
priority so gutas calls the treaty a
8:36
tribute to the survivors of nuclear
8:38
explosions which who are called the
8:39
hiusa and the hiusa who survived the
8:42
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
8:44
there's hardly any of them left they're
8:45
in their 80s they would have been around
8:47
2 years old or so the survivors and they
8:50
are they just got the Nobel Peace Prize
8:52
last year for their for their um efforts
8:55
now the fact of the matter is is that
8:57
the treaty was rejected by the Democrats
9:00
under Biden and also um under like vice
9:03
president Harris also didn't argue for
9:05
it during the um
9:08
election so it's now time with the onset
9:11
of the new bound treaty to reject
9:13
Reliance on the US president we're
9:15
seeing that even today in bulletin
9:17
Atomic scientists articles that we need
9:19
to make sure that it's not just the
9:21
decision of one person like Vladimir
9:23
Putin or Kim Jong-un or president Trump
9:26
because it could lead to the end of the
9:28
world as we know it that was the UN
9:31
General Assembly and I'll show you more
9:33
pictures of that in weeks to come but
9:35
here's a picture of the Korean Peninsula
9:37
and you can see that um I asked guy
9:40
Roberts whether there would be an attack
9:42
on pongyang and he argued that uh it
9:46
North Korea would be obliterated the
9:48
peninsula here at the top um if they
9:51
were to use nuclear weapons um or if
9:53
they were to try in a rogue attack to
9:55
like Pearl Harbor to attack the United
9:57
States so the that's an important fact
10:00
for us to and that brings me into the US
10:03
ballistic missile defense project so guy
10:06
was very reluctant to go there I
10:07
couldn't push him to go into that
10:09
direction he wasn't going to move um and
10:11
so even when we were talking about Kim
10:13
Jong-un and so on and the threat from
10:16
Kim Jong-un he wanted to se into South
10:19
Korea being a threat which took me
10:22
completely by surprise uh to argue that
10:24
South Korea is a threat um and and he
10:27
usually argues that China is a threat so
10:29
he didn't even argue that so you can see
10:31
my face as we're going through it I'm
10:34
going well what about the dprk and you
10:37
know their army the biggest conventional
10:39
army in the world approximately a
10:41
million men um very undernourished but
10:44
approximately 10,000 are fighting with
10:47
Russia along Ukraine but he didn't go
10:49
there nor did he go into chemical
10:51
weapons even later although Sudan um is
10:54
using chemical weapons now in fact he
10:56
explained to me that the a new POS new
10:59
under the president Trump Administration
11:01
is that there will be a separate
11:03
secretary of defense for biological um
11:05
assistant secretary of defense for
11:07
biological and chemical weapons and
11:08
nuclear will stand on its own because
11:10
it's such a big
11:12
portfolio Okay I'm getting into too much
11:14
detail but remember I get excited about
11:16
these things I'm passionate about I'm
11:17
very interested and I hope that my
11:19
interest will make you more passionate
11:20
so we talked a little bit um in in guy
11:24
Robert's interview about the the
11:26
possibility of uh North Korea using it
11:29
nuclear button and I always do like to
11:32
draw attention to the January speech by
11:34
Kim Jong-un he he tends every year to
11:36
make this speech and then argue that um
11:40
they can strike the United States where
11:42
would they strike around Seattle they
11:44
they they might be getting as close as
11:46
Seattle now so we don't know whether
11:48
president Trump will renew their
11:49
friendship but maybe that's something
11:51
that they can push
11:52
for okay what were the Tweets in reply
11:55
to those threats that's interesting now
11:57
because we look at that in mindsight and
11:59
go well interesting that uh president
12:02
Trump said that he had a bigger uh and
12:05
larger and more powerful nuclear button
12:09
um and that and his button Works meaning
12:11
that the modernization
12:14
worked I have to move quickly so there
12:16
that's some a picture of the
12:20
um that incident and then more threats
12:24
from Donald Trump so here he is making
12:26
threats by by Twitter by by tweeting
12:30
threats like this and that makes nuclear
12:32
weapons more usable and that's what a
12:35
guy talked about at length and when we
12:37
stopped the taping he went on and on
12:39
about usable nuclear weapons how that
12:42
enhances deterrence and he talked about
12:45
the the DAV Crockett and the supersonic
12:47
cruise missiles and how all these
12:49
nuclear weapons are more usable and that
12:51
means deterrence is more credible do you
12:54
get it so the DAV Crockett is an old
12:56
type of nuclear weapons then I start
12:58
talking about nuclear weapons that
12:59
Canada had the bow marks uh we had the
13:02
lacrosse and the Hest John and so on you
13:04
don't need to know about that right now
13:06
but moving on so at all times the US
13:10
president and the Russian president are
13:12
accompanied at all times by one single
13:15
soldier who carries the briefcase with
13:16
the codes the nuclear codes the soldier
13:19
never leaves the president's side we
13:21
don't know about the Russian
13:24
side so that is kind of risky but that
13:27
leads to the question going forward many
13:29
many questions about whether Canada
13:31
should join with the United States in
13:33
building the ballistic missile defense
13:35
project and there has been visits by
13:37
different people um to Canada arguing
13:40
that we have an obligation to be part of
13:43
that North American what called Fortress
13:45
America so should we continue to
13:48
participate in NORAD we are in NORAD
13:51
we've we've committed to it again we are
13:54
in northcom and we are rebuilding the
13:56
north warning system so those are the
13:58
figurative walls of Fortress America and
14:01
then there's the roof so we have not
14:03
built that yet it's not possible yet to
14:05
build
14:07
that and the problem is the the amount
14:10
so we're going to engage in excessive
14:13
militarization uh president Trump is
14:15
talking about the NATO allies spending
14:17
5% of their GDP Canada doesn't even
14:20
reach 2% so 5% would be a significant
14:23
hike in defense spending for all the
14:25
NATO allies and that tab which might be
14:28
more than 2% uh could rapidly escalate
14:31
because of the cost of building um a
14:33
fortress America so if Canada did decide
14:36
under the next um prime minister which
14:39
might be Pierre pev or it might be
14:41
Christia Freeland or Mark Carney we
14:42
don't know U might Canadian firms
14:45
actually benefit from working on that
14:47
sort of research it's an interesting
14:49
question most of those firms are in
14:51
Ottawa so what do high level officials
14:53
say we at need answers and these are
14:56
difficult questions I've invited quite a
14:58
few people to my class classes that are
14:59
from the United States I had um a
15:01
visitor Dr John man Mano when he was uh
15:04
NATO's assistant Secretary General in
15:06
charge of all of NATO's operations
15:08
visiting Detroit and then visiting my
15:10
class on the way there uh and he argued
15:13
in the class in front of the in-person
15:15
students that um Canada should
15:18
definitely definitely participate in in
15:20
the US space force and in the ballistic
15:22
missile defense which should be spelled
15:24
with an S there from the American
15:26
perspective but from our perspective
15:28
with a C
15:30
problematically in future years the US
15:33
missile defense system could establish
15:35
uh what's called a preemptive or um
15:38
first strike from space capability and
15:40
that would lead to the Chinese and the
15:42
uh Russians feeling insecure um and
15:45
feeling like our finger is on the
15:47
nuclear Tri trigger and that will make
15:48
them more insecure so Russia has been
15:50
very vocal about being opposed to a
15:53
ballistic missile defense system and the
15:55
question is whether those interceptors
15:57
would be up in Alaska or even in
15:59
Canada's
16:00
Arctic I'm moving fairly quickly but we
16:03
have to remember that we have a lot to
16:04
cover um and then we'll be ending on
16:06
nuclear proliferation but I was very
16:08
pleased that um guy Roberts came in my
16:11
lectures twice you heard the second one
16:13
if you were in my other classes you
16:15
heard the first one and now you could
16:17
hear he is more focused on South Korea
16:19
as a threat Saudi Arabia proliferation
16:22
all the things that I was worried about
16:24
before now he's worried about and he's
16:25
not so much worried about China what
16:28
does Tariq think I'm going to talk to
16:30
you about who he is in a
16:31
minute so guy Roberts strongly believed
16:35
as the at the head of when he was in in
16:37
charge of the project uh that the United
16:40
States had to modernize I was interested
16:42
because he did talk about the
16:44
modernization but he wasn't so worried
16:45
about Russia modernizing and uh the
16:48
global partnership program he was more
16:49
worried about the United States and that
16:51
brought me to bring in this quote from
16:54
uh president Trump before uh topof the
16:56
line best in the world so to me they
16:58
always want to make a better product um
17:02
and that's motivating
17:03
it but joining in bmd ballistic missile
17:07
defense could make Canada more insecure
17:09
this is a cartoon there is no such thing
17:12
that is operable right now but what
17:15
would happen is they would somehow
17:17
intercept incoming ballistic missiles
17:19
which no one can intercept right now and
17:22
then they would these errant missiles
17:24
would explode and the Fallout would
17:26
mainly fall over Canada because they
17:29
would be coming over the uh over the
17:31
North Pole over the Arctic the Russians
17:33
or the Iranians uh we don't know
17:37
so Quebec Quebec has a huge amount of of
17:41
land in the north and Quebec is solidly
17:44
against ballistic missile defense that's
17:46
very very interesting because they just
17:48
do not want to participate in this at
17:50
all I put a picture of Artis PP there
17:53
and Pierre Jasmine and other artists who
17:57
are um solidly against ballistic missile
17:59
defense and Steve Staples who spoke to
18:03
my class A couple years ago I'm not
18:05
using that lecture
18:07
anymore so to end do you think that the
18:10
Earth's orbit should remain a
18:11
demilitarized zone I put the options
18:14
here and the right answer is no right
18:15
answer because this opinion question you
18:17
cannot you can't ask these sorts of
18:19
questions in multiple choice because
18:20
it's your opinion it's your opinion so
18:23
there's no right answer that's the right
18:25
answer I wouldn't put that SRA of
18:26
question in in it but just so you know
18:28
okay I I think we're ending there and
18:30
now I want to go on to the next
18:36
part okay
