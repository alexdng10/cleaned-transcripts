0:01
Welcome to 3C or 3.3 on international
0:05
student institutions in Canada. So we're
0:08
beginning to speak more about the United
0:10
Nations, NATO and multilateral
0:13
institutions.
0:16
Let me uh begin the lecture by a live
0:19
update from President uh Trump. And I
0:22
wanted to insert this because in a way
0:24
Mr. Trump is beginning to undermine and
0:28
threaten international institutions.
0:31
Diplomats around the world are starting
0:33
to talk about that. And indeed, I'm
0:36
meeting with uh Tariq Ralph this
0:38
afternoon and uh 19 other diplomats on
0:42
Zoom hosted by me to talk about these
0:46
sorts of issues.
0:49
The first uh point to make today is that
0:52
the concern is that because Mr. Trump is
0:55
now claiming that he because he didn't
0:57
get the Nobel Peace Prize last year for
1:01
stopping eight wars. He sent a text
1:04
message not to the Nobel committee that
1:07
selects the Nobel Prize but to Norway's
1:10
prime minister and he is stating that he
1:13
can now because of I mean I guess his
1:16
ego is bruised he can now prioritize
1:20
what is good and proper for the United
1:22
States of America. So that has
1:24
implications for international law and
1:27
people are talking about whether this
1:29
means uh NATO is threatened, how is the
1:32
UN threatened. We're going to be talking
1:34
about these issues.
1:37
There's also uh questions about
1:39
sovereignty and the challenge by uh
1:42
possibly in some sort of technical way
1:45
or perhaps with an annexation
1:48
um that there could be a challenge to
1:50
Denmark's sovereignty and that would
1:53
cause the dissemination of of European
1:57
institutes. Mr. Trump is questioning
2:00
Denmark's legal claim to Den uh
2:02
Greenland and saying that there are no
2:04
written documents. There are written
2:07
documents, but he seems to be just
2:09
ignoring all of the documents in the
2:12
past. Um perhaps not reading them and
2:15
asserting now suddenly, this has never
2:18
been heard before that the United States
2:20
requires complete and total control of
2:23
the island of Greenland, which is
2:25
enormous. This message was recently just
2:29
circulated to European ambassadors in
2:32
Washington and it was published in many
2:35
uh newspapers including the New York
2:37
Times and Reuters.
2:39
Let's just uh I'm not expecting us to go
2:42
through the historical treaties and
2:44
legal recognition but here are just some
2:47
of them. So for example, there is that
2:49
2004 US Denmark Defense Pact that
2:53
explicitly recognizes Greenland as an
2:55
equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
2:57
It's still a kingdom. There is also um a
3:01
treaty that goes back to 1916 where the
3:04
US and Denmark purchased u they sold to
3:07
each other the Virgin Islands. So people
3:09
are asking does that mean that that
3:11
treaty doesn't hold anymore? This
3:14
contradicts this claim contradicts US
3:17
treaty commitments in the past.
3:21
Uh Denmark is maintaining that it it
3:23
cannot sell uh Greenland. There's so
3:26
many resources, so many natural
3:28
resources including all sorts of there's
3:31
60,000 people there. Uh should they
3:34
determine their own future? They're
3:36
saying in polls and in marches and in
3:38
protests, "No, no, no. Go home."
3:42
um the Mr. Vance and so on that are
3:45
visiting the vice president is visiting
3:48
and Steven Miller and the president is
3:51
now starting to um talk about increasing
3:55
the military presence very carefully.
3:57
So, the United States and the NATO
4:00
allies, I'll talk more about NATO uh in
4:02
future weeks. Again, we'll return to
4:04
this, but they're uh debating about how
4:07
to increase NATO's presence in
4:10
Greenland. Right now, Danish forces
4:12
patrol the uh area of Nuke. There's a
4:16
Danish ice breaker which breaks through
4:18
the ice and conducts um coastal patrols.
4:22
There were technical talks that were
4:24
just announced a couple of days ago but
4:27
no substantive progress. So this is what
4:30
diplomats are talking about and we're
4:31
holding a meeting as I mentioned this
4:33
afternoon including with our guest
4:34
speaker Dr. Tariq Ralph. So this is
4:37
another meeting I'm holding just with
4:38
high level uh diplomats.
4:42
We're actually going to be meeting uh to
4:44
make a long story short um on January
4:46
30th uh in the government of Canada and
4:49
the foreign affairs uh as part of some
4:52
nuclear arms control disarmment talks.
4:56
Okay. So I I put some uh slides here
4:58
about other occupations where technical
5:01
talks can serve as a precursor to
5:04
coercive uh forced escalation. And so we
5:06
learned about instruments, non-military
5:08
and military instruments of power. And I
5:11
asked you to do your own toolbox. Uh
5:13
some of the parallels here might be part
5:16
of your toolbox. Now this is not on the
5:19
scale of Hitler's in 1938. Not at all.
5:22
He has not used military force. Nor is
5:25
it on the scale of Russia's annexation
5:28
in 2014 of the Crimean Peninsula, which
5:31
I've talked to you about. And it's not
5:33
on the scale of the US annexation of
5:36
Hawaii, which was done against the
5:37
population's will, and the British
5:39
occupation of Egypt back in 1882. So
5:43
although there's a bit of a pattern here
5:45
of great powers acquiring uh territory,
5:49
there are still constraints in place and
5:51
those are diplomatic, international law
5:52
and all the things that Mr. uh Dr. Tariq
5:56
Ralph will be talking to you about.
5:59
Uh just to uh conclude here for a few
6:01
more slides, Canada is as we speak
6:04
considering a small deployment to
6:06
Greenland as part of a NATO exercise and
6:08
that would be part of Prime Minister
6:10
Carney's way of signaling solidarity and
6:13
the fact that they do not want to
6:15
escalate this into a war. So prime the
6:18
Prime Minister Carney is emphasizing
6:20
support for sovereignty and the
6:22
territorial integrity of Denmark and
6:25
Greenland which is part of it. Multiple
6:28
European states are already deploying
6:30
personnel in Greenland. So using Arctic
6:34
capable uh drills and Greenland is being
6:37
framed as a collective security issue.
6:44
It has not reached the UN yet. But I do
6:48
want to point out to you that um Dr.
6:50
Graph uh lives in um and and works in
6:54
Geneva in Geneva in Switzerland as part
6:57
of the United Nations. So this is the
6:59
gate going into the United Nations in
7:02
Geneva. There's another uh um part of
7:06
the United Nations that's also in um
7:10
Vienna.
7:13
So I need you to know some terms from
7:15
his biography. And I've put the
7:18
highlighter on now. um simply because I
7:20
want to make sure that you recognize
7:23
some of these words. So he was the
7:25
director of Cypriy. He'll I refer to
7:27
that and that is short for the Stockholm
7:30
Institute uh for peace and uh research
7:34
and Stockholm International Peace
7:36
Research Institute. Uh and he's been
7:39
long involved with that. We always just
7:41
say CRI. He is a recognized authority on
7:45
nuclear disarmament and
7:46
non-prololiferation issues. and I was
7:48
very pleased to get them for this class.
7:50
And this was a recording that I did
7:52
exactly one year ago. So, I'm not going
7:54
to eliminate this recording. I want I
7:57
think it's still relevant. Um, he was
8:00
senior adviser on the 2015 uh
8:03
non-prololiferation treaty review
8:06
conference. So, I've already said that
8:08
the NPT review conference quite a few
8:10
times for you and it needs to just roll
8:12
off your lips. The NPT review
8:14
conference. Some people will even say
8:15
the NPT RevCon, and you're supposed to
8:17
know what that was.
8:19
He was also the head of the verification
8:22
and security policy coordination office
8:24
at the IAEA,
8:26
the International Atomic Energy Agency,
8:28
but we always just say IAEA. Um, and he
8:30
reported to the director general who
8:32
later um got the Nobel Peace Prize. Uh
8:35
he also was involved with these
8:37
verification cases. So you can see these
8:39
are all very complicated verification
8:40
cases and he was coordinator. He knows a
8:43
lot about the nuclear uh fuel cycle. He
8:46
was the alternate head of the IAEA
8:48
delegations to the MPT review
8:50
conferences from 23 2003. So he's a he's
8:53
a very good writer and I've seen him
8:55
over three decades, 30 35 years now. um
9:01
we've been working together and so I I
9:03
was really pleased that he agreed to
9:04
come to the class to a secondyear cl
9:07
it's a second year class although many
9:09
of you are third or fourth year and to
9:12
to to help us out a little bit.
9:16
So I I mentioned to you now I will be
9:18
going to what's called the Nuclear Arms
9:20
Control and Disarmament uh consultation
9:23
hosted by Global Affairs Canada GA um on
9:27
January 30th. I'm saying a lot of ums,
9:29
but I want you to just hear how the
9:32
words go together. It's kind of like
9:34
another language when you're in foreign
9:36
affairs. Uh, CRI, uh, Knack and so on.
9:41
NACD, NORAD, OCE, Unadir, UNOPS, UNGA,
9:46
like we use all those sorts of acronyms.
9:49
The NPT RevCon is going to take place in
9:52
2026, which is also why we're having the
9:55
discussion this afternoon. and um on
9:58
January 30th. So, I'm hosting a
10:00
discussion by Zoom among diplomats cuz I
10:02
want us to be ready for the Global
10:04
Affairs Canada discussions. It's hard
10:07
work to learn all these um acronyms.
10:10
It's hard work at the beginning, but it
10:11
makes life a lot easier if you can just
10:13
memorize them. Every organization has a
10:16
different name for the head of the
10:18
organization. A person might say the SEC
10:20
gen or the deputy SEC gen, the head, the
10:23
P, the PM, the president. that's their
10:26
boss. Uh, if you're an expert advisor, I
10:30
think it's better for your long-term job
10:33
security to be a generalist rather than
10:35
an expert. The government of Canada,
10:37
especially global affairs Canada,
10:40
pronounced GAK, formerly the Department
10:42
of Foreign Affairs and before that the
10:45
Department of External Affairs, DEA, um,
10:48
prefers generalists rather than
10:50
specialists. They want people who know a
10:52
lot rather than one simp small area.
10:57
It's hard work and I think that AI can
10:59
help you quickly learn a lot really
11:02
fast. You can make your own multiple
11:04
choice questions. You can quiz yourself.
11:06
You can ask uh AI you know what is the
11:09
NPT RevCon and here it tells you it
11:11
tells you tells you all this stuff which
11:14
is you know we used to have to have go
11:15
to fact sheets and things. Now of course
11:17
it can be wrong but it's often right and
11:20
I was very impressed. Now Dr. Right.
11:23
Ralph spoke to us from Italy. Although
11:25
he works in Geneva at the UN office, he
11:28
always expects you to listen. No
11:31
interrupting and he speaks very very
11:34
quickly.
11:37
There he is. He's often on uh he's what
11:39
we call a talking head around the world.
11:42
A person who speaks on behalf of himself
11:45
or in this case CRI and um that's his
11:49
his what we call the headsh shot. So,
11:52
um,
11:56
head shot are under pressure these days.
11:57
I'm also what's called a talking head.
11:59
So, the media will often contact me
12:02
written. Um, I prefer written uh
12:05
compared to doing Skype or doing
12:09
anything on TV. I can't control the
12:11
outcome that way. And over the years, my
12:13
my tendency has been to write back. So
12:16
here just a few minutes ago is a typical
12:19
question for a topping head, but it's
12:21
not typical because of Mr. Trump. So
12:24
what they're interested is a piece on a
12:27
hypothetical American military invasion
12:29
of Canada, what it might look like and
12:32
how it might resolve given your
12:35
background. That's because I wrote an
12:36
article in the Glob Mail on this last
12:38
June. I was wondering if you'd be open
12:41
to it. So I don't like to do the phone
12:43
interview students because they can take
12:45
out of context what you said. So
12:47
generally I will write something back to
12:49
them. Don't use chat. Um so the here's
12:53
their questions that they want to ask
12:55
me. Do you believe it how likely do you
12:59
believe it is for the US to take
13:00
military action at this juncture against
13:03
Canada?
13:04
I don't know what might prompt the US to
13:07
take such measures. Well, they want the
13:09
Great Lakes. They want the Arctic. I
13:11
don't know. I am probably not going to
13:13
respond to this. How might a military
13:15
invasion of Canada go? Wow. That's the
13:18
Toronto Star. Talking heads are under
13:21
pressure these days.
13:24
Okay. So, let's say you want to use um
13:26
AI to learn the language of
13:30
international institutions, which I'd
13:32
like you to learn. You know, I often say
13:34
the UN, NATO, the WTO. uh but as you
13:38
become more specialized you learn more
13:40
things like the OECD the OAS IMF and so
13:45
on so it depends there's there's
13:47
thousands of international institutions
13:50
I can't quiz you on all those names you
13:52
have to figure out but I do expect you
13:54
to know the ones here these ones in
13:56
yellow so you must know these for the
13:59
multiplechoice exam
14:02
for the multiple choice exam I also
14:04
expect you to know the World Bank group.
14:07
I want you to know the organization for
14:10
security and cooperation in Europe. See
14:12
the hyphen OCE
14:15
Canada participates in this forum. We
14:17
are a member of this forum and this is
14:19
one way we can become involved in
14:21
European defense. NATO and the OCE
14:24
the five eyes intelligence alliance. So
14:27
these are the United States, the United
14:29
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand. So
14:32
those are all the English-speaking five
14:34
eyes. And then the arms trade treaty
14:37
which I will talk up to you again about
14:39
um in the future. Canada's a signatory
14:41
to that treaty and Canada's a signatory
14:44
to the United Nations Framework
14:47
Convention on Climate Change which the
14:49
United States has withdrawn from
14:52
global governance. Canada is part of the
14:55
International Criminal Court, the IC.
14:59
Uh Canada is also a part of the
15:02
International Court of Justice. And then
15:05
Canada, as I mentioned, is part of the
15:07
IAEA.
15:09
The IAEA, we're a major supporter
15:11
because we're a nuclear power and we
15:12
have the second most uranium in the
15:14
world. We're a major supporter of
15:16
nuclear safety, security, and
15:18
non-prololiferation initiatives.
15:21
Which is also why I'm going to Ottawa at
15:23
the end of January to talk about uh
15:25
non-prololiferation initiatives.
15:29
I'll be there for quite a while um
15:31
talking not talking about this. So I'm
15:34
not an expert on um this would be
15:36
intellectual property. This is more for
15:39
people who go into law if you're
15:40
interested in intellectual property.
15:43
Kerna, some people say CERN, the
15:45
European Organization for Nuclear
15:47
Research. So I I have found over the
15:50
years that scientists from Geneva say
15:52
CERN, they don't say Kerna. And then the
15:55
United Nations Development Program,
15:57
UNDEP. So here AI is telling me do you
16:01
need need any details on specific
16:03
membership?
16:05
Interesting.
16:08
Dr. Ralph in his talk speaks about this
16:10
school. That's where he was at at in
16:12
Italy at the school in February which is
16:15
a nice time to be um in Italy. And this
16:18
is the school and he mentions it and I
16:20
put the website there. I have not
16:22
attended this school. It is I'm sure
16:24
quite expensive.
16:27
Finally, if you do want to become
16:29
involved, it is best to become involved
16:31
with the Canadian Volunteer Initiative
16:33
at the beginning and then go
16:35
international. So, I'm the president of
16:37
the Canadian Peace Research Association,
16:39
which is another institution,
16:41
international institution based in
16:42
Canada. And there's our website. Uh, and
16:45
if you're interested in joining, that
16:47
would be um something that you could
16:48
consider. I hope that u but I'm not
16:51
pressuring you to do so and it would not
16:52
change your mark in this class. If you
16:55
are going to ask me to present because
16:57
you are trying to apply to med school,
16:58
my new policy is that um I will not uh
17:02
allow you to present so that you can
17:04
fill that part out of the med school
17:08
application where you can say you um did
17:10
something for a volunteer thing. I'm I'm
17:12
starting to doubt the the motives of
17:14
students that are asking me to to give a
17:17
presentation and realizing that it's I
17:19
mean I got a few calls this week and
17:21
people visiting my office hours and I
17:24
think it's best to join something like
17:25
the cross-cultural learner center if
17:28
you're interested in law uh downtown
17:31
work with cross-cultural new immigrants.
17:34
I don't think working with this
17:36
association and then trying to get into
17:38
med school or law is is a good idea. But
17:40
maybe if you're interested in
17:41
international law,
