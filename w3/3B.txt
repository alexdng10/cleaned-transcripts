0:01
welcome to lesson 3B which is on the
0:04
nuclear nonproliferation treaty the MPT
0:07
and the prohibition band treaty and
0:09
we're getting more into issues to do
0:12
with Ukraine to do with arms control to
0:14
do with our guest speaker and then that
0:17
equips us to understand our guest
0:19
speaker and hopefully equips you as a
0:22
global
0:25
citizen I put a picture of myself there
0:28
because there's no room for the video uh
0:31
often I like to put more pictures in
0:33
it's more useful for us to have pictures
0:36
so uh what do I want to say here um in
0:39
the last lecture I I I mentioned that I
0:43
can't test you on opinion whether we
0:45
should have a a a fortress America
0:48
whether a space force is a good idea or
0:50
not I can test you on whether people
0:52
think that's a good idea I can test you
0:55
on facts and dates so a lot of students
0:57
keep a separate list of dates as I'm
0:59
lecturing and they just memorize them um
1:02
if you want to serve Canada abroad or
1:04
you want to be a global citizen or a
1:05
student traveler you do need to think
1:07
about issues to do with nuclear weapons
1:10
and the bound
1:14
treaty the Bay of Pigs uh Fiasco uh was
1:18
was uh featured by a decision by John F
1:22
Kennedy pictured here I do often put in
1:25
pictures of famous diplomats and ask you
1:27
to identify them so I don't just I ask
1:30
you about the pictures as well he set up
1:32
an
1:33
XCOM uh which All Bright space does not
1:36
like it will frequently change the word
1:38
XCOM here to X it does just doesn't like
1:42
it it will automatically change it to
1:44
something else it doesn't understand oh
1:46
bright space anyway he wanted it to
1:49
guide his decision-making during the
1:51
Cuban Missile
1:53
Crisis the Cuban Missile Crisis happened
1:55
60 years ago more than 60 years ago and
1:58
since then we've had a number of other
2:00
crises let me talk about former US
2:03
President Joseph Biden during his uh
2:06
Reign he ignored the wise and Sage
2:09
advice of military personnel and
2:11
Military brass on the crisis in
2:13
Afghanistan and he actually ignored the
2:15
advice of his defense secretary so we
2:18
are talking to the assistant Secretary
2:20
of Defense guy Roberts and um Biden also
2:24
ignored lyd Austin's advice and then
2:26
pull the troops out of a of Afghanistan
2:30
by August 30th 2021 that was contrary to
2:33
the advice of many diplomats who argued
2:36
that the United States should undertake
2:38
a conditions-based negotiations withdraw
2:41
when it was a good time in Afghanistan
2:43
rather than when it was a time decision
2:46
time-based decision for the United
2:47
States the US wanted to withdraw due to
2:51
the cost and the numbers of of dead and
2:54
and uh named people
3:00
the US Secretary of State then uh
3:03
Anthony blinkin appeared bullish another
3:05
word for hawkish on Russia and Ukraine
3:07
for example he spoke firmly against
3:09
Russian signals that they would invade
3:12
at the NATO foreign ministers meeting in
3:14
Ria I'll show you where R is in a minute
3:17
uh on December 1st before the actual
3:19
February 24th 22nd 2022 Invasion so
3:24
recall that Kennedy himself ordered or
3:27
encouraged behind the scenes the excom
3:30
adviser General Maxwell Taylor I said
3:32
recall but um you haven't learned that
3:34
yet but he asked him to declare
3:37
bellicose threats in favor of conducting
3:40
a nuclear strike in order to see what
3:42
the XCOM would argue meanwhile behind
3:45
the scenes Kennedy's own brother Robert
3:48
Kennedy pictured here or sometimes
3:51
called Bobby Kennedy he was also
3:53
assassinated later uh so both Kennedy
3:55
brothers were assassinated they
3:57
counseled enormous restraint not to
4:00
preemptively strike Russia not to
4:03
undertake a first strike against Russia
4:05
during the entire
4:08
crisis so 60 years later the Cuban
4:11
Missile Crisis is over and you heard me
4:13
and Guy Roberts refer to the nuclear
4:16
taboo which is the idea of a normative
4:19
meaning a a learned inhibition against
4:22
the first use of nuclear weapons the
4:24
idea that most states do not want to go
4:26
down in history as having used nuclear
4:28
weapons first the United States so far
4:31
is the only first country in history to
4:33
use them first in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
4:36
and so that we saw the results of it you
4:39
didn't but we've seen it um in many
4:41
pictures and so on and those new
4:42
findings suggest the view that even a
4:44
medium scale nuclear war would bring
4:47
about a global nuclear winter and you
4:49
heard guy Roberts refer to that
4:53
too the US decision to deploy
4:56
intermediate range nuclear missiles in
4:59
Europe so you heard guy talk about
5:01
intermediate uh intermediate uh nuclear
5:04
weapons some people call those tactical
5:07
nuclear weapons uh and so the the the
5:10
vocabulary is not well defined what's
5:12
tactical what's strategic and so on what
5:15
we do know is that Russian President
5:17
Vladimir Putin say that these are a
5:20
great danger and threat to us and he has
5:22
claimed that the arms race between
5:24
Russia and the United States was
5:27
intensifying now the uh Russians uh talk
5:31
about Washington's withdrawal from the
5:33
1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and
5:36
the American withdrawal first from the
5:38
1987 open Skies treaty the ABM Treaty
5:42
which dates back to
5:44
1972 was put in place after the Cuban
5:47
Missile Crisis uh in 1972 so the Cuban
5:50
Missile Crisis in 1962 and then the ABM
5:53
Treaty the United States withdrew from
5:56
both first uh the United States was
5:59
non-com CL client non compliant um
6:03
before Russia so guy Roberts was
6:05
incorrect but during the dis you you saw
6:08
me um be ambiguous you never correct
6:10
people publicly on tap no actually never
6:13
correct
6:16
people Russia finalized its withdrawal
6:18
from the 1992 open Skies treaty on
6:21
December 18th
6:23
2021 the United States withdrew from it
6:26
first President Putin often complained
6:29
about activity near Russia's borders and
6:31
he claimed that Russian forces could
6:33
closely observe these different um Navy
6:36
command ships so they were worried about
6:39
a possible attack by NATO uh and the
6:42
exercises by NATO with different uh
6:45
warships concern them I bring that up uh
6:48
now because we will talk in the future
6:51
about the Black
6:54
Sea moving on on Russia's troop buildup
6:57
near Ukraine NATO's Secret AR Jen which
7:01
uh guy Roberts will say SE gen uh
7:03
stoltenberg stressed before The Invasion
7:06
that there will be a high price to pay
7:08
these are the deterrent threats that
7:10
they put in place before the Russian
7:13
aggression and obviously that failed and
7:16
they they uh Ukraine is still not one of
7:20
um the NATO allies they extended out
7:23
invitations for it to be a partner but
7:27
uh uh Ukraine and Georgia are Partners
7:31
but they are not allies at the time
7:35
Sweden and Finland had not joined after
7:38
the Russian invasion Sweden and Finland
7:41
joined NATO so now there are 32 members
7:44
of NATO
7:47
32 I'm moving quickly covering a lot of
7:50
time a lot of things here's Ria uh laia
7:53
uh and here's here's Lavia and there's
7:56
Ria and they wanted to consider how they
7:59
would deal with Russia's troop buildup
8:02
near Ukraine and they discussed how to
8:04
deter but obviously they didn't they
8:06
weren't able to deter they were very
8:10
aware that in
8:12
2014 Russia annexed invaded occupied and
8:15
annexed the Crimean peninsula here which
8:18
was part of and is still part of Ukraine
8:21
but it is now annexed by uh Russia and
8:25
so the president of Ukraine uh who we
8:28
nobody knows who he was back then but
8:30
now we all know who he is and the prime
8:32
minister of Georgia visited NATO
8:34
headquarters during the covid
8:39
pandemic at that time uh Canada decided
8:43
to send more armed forces the Canadian
8:45
Armed Forces to op what's called
8:46
operation reassurance in Central and
8:49
Eastern Europe in order to detour to
8:52
Signal Canada's willingness to be part
8:54
of a collaborative Collective defense by
8:57
NATO after the meeting in R blinken and
9:01
Biden told the world press that the
9:03
United States would respond to a
9:05
possible Invasion with a range of high
9:08
impact economic sanctions and we're
9:10
going to have a special guest speaker
9:12
who help put in place those sanctions so
9:14
that's going to be a very exciting um a
9:16
Foreign Service Officer from the
9:18
government of Canada has agreed to talk
9:20
to us about this and that should be
9:21
quite interesting and that is also part
9:24
of the strengthening of Alliance
9:26
defenses on NATO's Eastern flank
9:32
okay President Biden and President Putin
9:34
held a video call uh here you can see uh
9:37
it from president uh Putin's perspective
9:40
to quell the crisis I under NATO
9:42
Arrangements at that time shrouded in
9:45
secrecy guy Roberts does refer obliquely
9:48
to the tactical nuclear weapons that are
9:51
owned by and controlled by the United
9:54
States their American nuclear weapons
9:56
and they're in five NATO Allied
9:58
countries
9:59
there's approximately 150 of them we we
10:02
don't really know for sure how many
10:04
there are and these are dual capable um
10:08
on Dual capable
10:09
aircraft meaning they could deliver
10:11
conventional or nuclear weapons and
10:13
that's another
10:16
[Music]
10:18
issue so under the NATO Arrangements
10:22
which are still shrouded in secrecy
10:24
there's five states Belgium Germany
10:27
Italy the Netherlands and turkey that
10:29
host up to we don't know 150 nuclear
10:32
weapons and they may have been moved out
10:35
of the United Kingdom maybe they're in
10:37
Scotland we're not sure they're here in
10:40
Turkey which some people think is risky
10:42
because if Turkey was taken over uh
10:45
these are in a small village in surck uh
10:48
and then there's some in in Italy and
10:50
Germany and the
10:54
Netherlands in May 2023 Russia began
10:58
deploying Tactical nuclear weapons in
11:00
Bellas so Bellas is a military
11:03
dictatorship that is situated north of
11:05
Ukraine and east of kenrad which is the
11:09
Russia's Baltic Sea Enclave here on the
11:12
Baltic Sea during the 1990s
11:16
Bellas along with Kazakhstan not
11:19
pictured here and Ukraine surrendered
11:22
their nuclear arsenals to Russia in
11:25
exchange for security assurances so you
11:28
heard uh guy Robert let talk about
11:29
security insurances they they allowed
11:33
the um Russians to pull back their own
11:35
nuclear weapons back into Russia in
11:37
exchange for security insurances from
11:39
Russia the United States and the United
11:41
Kingdom that's why you'll hear many
11:43
people are very critical uh that uh the
11:46
United States did not defend uh Ukraine
11:49
in the wake of the invasion belus is a
11:52
military ally and that is where the
11:54
Russians are deploying troops it's a
11:56
staging ground for Russian forces uh and
11:59
it continues to be so um during their
12:02
Northern
12:04
Invasion they're coming from the north
12:06
into Ukraine in early
12:10
2022 so where is kenrad in this giant
12:13
picture uh it's interesting the maps are
12:15
always red of Russia and so this is
12:17
their Russian Enclave kenrad where they
12:21
are also deploying uh tactical nuclear
12:25
weapons the secret agreement back in 196
12:29
2 uh was and the real outcome was that
12:32
the United States agreed to withdraw its
12:35
tactical nuclear weapons which were
12:36
called Jupiter missiles from Turkey so
12:39
the United States pulled them out of
12:40
turkey in exchange for Russian
12:43
withdrawal of its tactical nuclear
12:45
weapons from Cuba that was the exchange
12:47
behind the scenes in Secret Letters
12:49
between uh kushev the Russian uh
12:52
president and uh President Kennedy now
12:56
with tensions at their worst since 198 9
12:59
1990 when the Cold War ended 30 years
13:02
ago three decades ago we see that the
13:05
Russians are threatening and they have
13:07
have threatened to deploy nuclear
13:09
missiles as
13:13
well the Russian incident on the Black
13:16
Sea uh in June 2021 led to more uh
13:20
tensions the Russians have been
13:21
complained for a long time about NATO
13:23
exercises on the Black Sea which they
13:25
consider to be threatening the drills
13:28
the thousands of troops dozens of ships
13:31
and um they do need to have more
13:33
transparency more new thinking about the
13:36
Black Sea um at NATO
13:41
headquarters here's Yen stoltenberg he
13:44
was one of NATO's longest serving
13:45
leaders since 2014 since uh and he his
13:49
term was extended by two years and then
13:51
two years during the crisis and he
13:54
remained focused on Military Readiness
13:56
increasing defense spending investing in
13:58
major equipment new technology cyber
14:00
warfare outer space the new Secretary
14:04
General is Mark Ruta who is the outgoing
14:07
prime minister of the Netherlands so
14:09
he's the former Dutch prime
14:14
minister in Washington both the
14:16
Republican and the Democratic parties
14:18
acted in a bipartisan fa fashion and you
14:21
hear guy Roberts speak about that at
14:23
length in terms of the amounts of
14:25
spending that are being put forward by
14:28
both part parties in agreement the 200
14:31
2022 spending was 768 now it's actually
14:35
842 billion and you hear guy talk about
14:38
that that's as he puts it a you know an
14:41
unfathomable amount of money to be spent
14:44
per year so how much is it approximately
14:46
well he says around 850 but they agreed
14:49
on 842 billion I would add that the
14:52
United States then is the most powerful
14:55
military country on Earth uh despite its
14:58
own decaying infrastructure its lack of
15:00
free medical care and the onslaught of a
15:03
pandemic that surpassed 1 million total
15:06
deaths far more than in
15:10
Canada proportionately taken together
15:13
the consequences of military escalation
15:16
over Ukraine are very serious for
15:18
humankind and for all Earth species
15:21
because of the nature of war and
15:23
technology in this Century military
15:26
satellites in spaces vulnerable atmosph
15:29
feric Zone combined with complete
15:31
Reliance on Military communication by
15:33
computer mean that the former cold Wars
15:36
bipolar system between the United States
15:39
and Russia is now multi-polar and
15:42
therefore more less controllable quickly
15:48
uncontrollable Decisions by Third
15:50
parties unlike during the Cuban Missile
15:52
Crisis here you see Kev and Kennedy
15:55
meeting together um we don't see that
15:59
we we the problem is that Decisions by
16:01
Third parties like China and the United
16:04
Kingdom's decision to increase its
16:06
nuclear warhead stock Ball P caps can
16:09
defy logic you heard guy Roberts start
16:12
to talk about Game Theory uh and the
16:15
need for um understanding the the the
16:18
Chinese buildup I can't recall if during
16:21
the taping he talked about the Chinese
16:23
buildup but he um here to four has
16:26
always been very concerned about Chinese
16:28
missiles and their
16:30
buildup back then in Game Theory
16:33
traditional Game Theory uh I have not
16:36
taught that to you and I will not be
16:37
teaching Game Theory to this class but
16:39
if you took my other classes we talk
16:41
about Game Theory and we talk about new
16:44
ways to amarate the tensions so things
16:47
like letters um but that that's all been
16:50
jettison now in favor of digital
16:52
communication so we're in a new age as
16:53
you
16:55
know and now I mean you heard guy Robert
16:58
talk about threats to annihilate he kept
17:01
I couldn't he kept talking about uh how
17:04
we've issued we the United States have
17:06
issued threats uh to North Korea and so
17:10
on so now threats to annihilate are
17:12
hurled in seconds using Twitter and
17:14
they're not really as newsworthy because
17:17
they're distributed so widely people are
17:19
are kind of deja vu they're they're used
17:21
to it uh former US Secretary of Defense
17:25
assistant Secretary of Defense Roberts
17:26
hinted that they are in news releases
17:28
phone calls and in explicit threats
17:31
delivered by diplomats including with
17:33
press uh to by to the Press so that was
17:36
quite fascinating uh very interesting
17:39
part of our
17:41
taping just need to move on we're at 17
17:44
minutes and I need to be done in 20
17:46
minutes uh here's uh Fidel Castro he was
17:50
the president of Cuba during the Cuban
17:52
Missile Crisis and during the Bay of
17:53
Pigs and he schemed for weeks that us
17:56
intelligence he was worried would notice
17:58
the movement nowadays to move even
18:02
10,000 soldiers is very visible we know
18:04
that there's North Korean soldiers along
18:06
the uh Ukraine uh front deployed by
18:09
Russia back then you could secretly do
18:13
this and the United States couldn't see
18:15
from space but now it's impossible uh
18:18
they can see a license plate from
18:22
space so that does mean that it's
18:24
possible um that the International
18:27
Community can act quickly and instead of
18:29
engaging in weeks of speculation the
18:32
International Community can quarantine
18:35
using for example travel bands within
18:38
hours over all sorts of things including
18:41
before we quarantined important
18:43
countries because of the Ebola virus uh
18:45
we have quarantined because of China and
18:47
Russia over fears of the Corona virus
18:49
and so on we're going to talk about
18:51
sanctions uh with uh ad deian plov who
18:55
is a diplomat who helped put those
18:57
sanctions in place and we're going to
18:59
talk about that but let's just focus for
19:01
a moment on this date 2007 the Russians
19:04
Landmark Cyber attack on Estonia another
19:07
NATO Ally so they attacked the
19:09
government and the banking structure so
19:11
far they have not attacked the NATO
19:13
allies uh infrastructure they've just
19:17
focused on
19:20
Ukraine which brings me to North Korea
19:23
and Guy Roberts went there but then he
19:25
went into South Korea being a threat uh
19:28
which was a new threat and surprised me
19:31
uh normally he would refer to North
19:33
Korea's attempts to count uh conduct
19:37
hacking cyber warfare against big
19:39
companies like Google and Sony and then
19:42
he would be worried about Afghanistan
19:44
but you heard not a word about
19:46
Afghanistan from him during the entire
19:48
taping and uh basically the concern is
19:52
that emerging cyber warfare capabilities
19:55
will rapidly complicate the Ukraine
19:59
military crisis so let's leave that and
20:01
and I've got right to 20 minutes here
20:04
and there's some pictures of the North
20:05
Korean cyber Warrior soldiers beinging
20:09
trained in
20:10
China in a secret location in China and
20:13
some pictures of the Taliban which took
20:15
over Afghanistan and are in charge and
20:18
are the unrecognized government
