00:00 so you want to record the hi thank you
00:02 very much I want to introduce you to Dr
00:05 Tariq Ralph who is a very longtime
00:08 Diplomat very famous in terms of the
00:10 international atomic energy agency and
00:13 has spent a lifetime negotiating with
00:16 other diplomats all around the world
00:19 regarding the nuclear nonproliferation
00:22 treaty and I've asked him to come on
00:24 tonight he's actually speaking to us
00:26 from Europe from Italy where he's
00:29 teaching an arms control thank you very
00:31 much Tariq for coming on um and maybe
00:36 just wave for can I hear you hi oh okay
00:40 I wanted to ask you a few questions I
00:42 know that we don't have a lot of time um
00:44 I'm wondering whether you think that the
00:47 uh United States and Russia have
00:48 violated many of the bilateral and
00:51 multilateral arms control treaties that
00:54 have been negotiated during the Cold War
00:56 and beforehand for example the
00:58 biological toxic weapons convention the
01:00 chemical weapons convention and so on do
01:03 you think that they've violated those
01:05 and that's why they've withdrawn from
01:08 them so that's a good question Erica and
01:12 hello to all the students so as as Erica
01:15 mentioned there are two categories of
01:16 Arms Control treaties between the United
01:19 States and the Soviet Union Russia in
01:22 the bilateral treaties each country
01:24 makes the
01:25 determination whether or not the other
01:27 party is in non-compliance with the the
01:30 treaty obligations so for the most part
01:34 it is the United States that has first
01:36 raised non-compliance concerns regarding
01:39 the behavior of uh the Soviet Union and
01:42 then of Russia and then usually the
01:45 Soviet Union or the Russian side would
01:48 reply uh accusing the United States of
01:51 non-compliance as well so they tried to
01:53 match each other now uh the United
01:57 States withdrew from the 1972 anti-b IC
02:00 missile treaty in 2002 but they did it
02:04 legally they used the withdrawal Clause
02:06 they gave the required notice and at the
02:08 end of the notice they stepped out of
02:10 the uh anti-ballistic missile treaty now
02:14 the international sorry intermediate and
02:17 shorter range nuclear forces treaty the
02:19 INF treaty which was signed in
02:22 1987 uh the Obama Administration
02:25 starting in about
02:27 2016 started uh accusing Russia of
02:31 developing a cruise missile that in the
02:34 US's opinion exceeded the 500 kilometer
02:40 uh range uh that was not allowed under
02:43 the INF
02:45 treaty so the Russians said well this uh
02:48 missile is a derivative of a
02:52 conventionally armed cruise missile so
02:55 the conventionally armed cruise missile
02:57 the Russians said had a range of 49
03:01 kilometers and the nuclear armed version
03:03 the Russians said had a range of
03:06 480 kilometers and therefore the
03:08 Russians said that it was within the
03:10 allowed limits the United States
03:13 responded that this was not their
03:15 interpretation and that if the missile
03:17 was F fully
03:19 fueled uh it would travel a distance in
03:23 excess of 500
03:25 kilometers but the United States never
03:28 made public to us
03:31 these this detail that I just talked
03:33 about they just said Russia is in
03:34 violation so it took the Trump
03:37 Administration which identified this
03:39 missile as the 9
03:42 m729 and citing that as a violation the
03:46 United States withdrew from the INF
03:48 treaty and then the Russians said well
03:49 if you're withdrawing we are withdrawing
03:51 as well now in your previous getting
03:54 into a lot of detail I was on radio
03:56 about the INF treaty and I was allowed 5
03:58 minutes and that was it nobody knew the
04:00 INF treaty was um you know was all
04:03 across Canada that the United States had
04:05 withdrawn um and so people were alarmed
04:08 and I think we're alarmed at all the
04:09 arms control treaties that are falling
04:11 by the wayside and we're entering a
04:13 nuclear jungle are you worried about
04:15 accidental nuclear war to deliver it
04:17 strategic War do you think there's going
04:19 to be AAL nuclear war in Europe at the
04:22 moment the yes at the moment there is
04:25 only one treaty standing between Moscow
04:27 and Washington and that is the new start
04:29 treaty
04:31 which will expire on the I think 8th of
04:33 February 2026 yeah there are no
04:36 negotiations and no talks so as of 9 or
04:40 10 February 2026 for the first time in
04:42 more than half a century neither Russia
04:45 nor the United States will be
04:47 constrained by any treaty
04:49 although both sides have suspended new
04:52 start but both sides have committed that
04:54 they will remain within the numerical
04:56 limits and thus far neither the us nor
04:59 Russia has accused the other of stepping
05:02 over and they're not testing above
05:05 ground either and they're not testing
05:06 underground so that's kind of optimistic
05:08 well that is because of the
05:09 comprehensive nuclear testband treaty
05:12 yeah although uh United States rejected
05:15 ratification in
05:16 1999 Russia withdrew its ratification in
05:19 2023 but is still committed to uh the
05:23 treaty now uh Eric for the first time we
05:27 have six nuclear armed States engaged in
05:30 an armed conflict United States France
05:34 and United Kingdom on the one side in
05:37 the Ukraine war Russia supported by
05:40 China and North Korea on the other side
05:42 in the Ukraine war and for the first
05:44 time a major nuclear power is being
05:48 attacked on its own territory these are
05:51 the long range fires from Ukraine into
05:54 Russia beyond the occupied territories
05:57 this has never happened before yeah I Al
06:00 have been sounding the alarm for many
06:02 months and you would have seen my posts
06:04 on Canadian pagash yeah that we seem to
06:07 be sliding towards an accidental nuclear
06:10 war much like we slid into a war the
06:14 first world
06:16 war so people are dismissing Russia's
06:19 threats to use nuclear weapons saying
06:21 they are not credible we don't believe
06:23 them but we never know when we will have
06:25 the proverbial straw that broke the
06:27 camels
06:28 back yeah I'm very very concerned about
06:30 a limited nuclear war uh what about are
06:34 you concerned about the Saudis obtaining
06:36 nuclear weapons in reply to Iran and
06:38 then Israel uh having it its bomb in the
06:41 basement revealing it are you concerned
06:43 about proliferation and do you think
06:45 that's another reason do you think
06:47 that's another reason that we should be
06:49 worried I mean we're worried about the
06:51 the six nuclear Powers engaged in
06:53 Ukraine but we are also worried about a
06:56 small tactical nuclear war between let's
06:58 say India Pakistan leading to nuclear
07:00 winter I I this here in andelo I've been
07:04 criticizing all my colleagues who for
07:07 years have been lecturing India and
07:09 Pakistan on avoiding a nuclear war and
07:11 guess what they themselves are doing so
07:13 I am not worried about the nuclear war
07:16 starting in South Asia in the current
07:18 circumstances okay so um coming back to
07:22 what about between North and South Korea
07:24 then you're not worried about that
07:25 either in Japan this is an issue that
07:27 has what is being discussed here
07:29 actively uhuh the the president of South
07:32 Korea this president who has now been
07:34 arrested yeah if you remember in January
07:36 came out openly and said South Korea
07:38 would acquire nuclear weapons and then
07:40 he was beaten down by the United States
07:42 and two weeks later he
07:43 recanted so there is concern about South
07:46 Korea then this would not be the first
07:48 time that South Korea has made noises
07:50 about getting nuclear weapons so I don't
07:54 think that South Korea is going to go
07:56 down that path at the moment now coming
07:59 to Saudi Arabia y so it's interesting
08:01 that I was told by my Israeli colleague
08:04 here that recently Israel Declassified
08:08 some commentary by some scientists who
08:12 had built the Demona facility where uh
08:16 Israel's nuclear weapons were built so
08:18 they were signaling something now your
08:21 previous guest Guy Roberts in my view
08:23 was wrong when he said the nuclear power
08:26 reactors under construction in turkey or
08:30 Arabia could be used to make nuclear
08:32 weapons this is just not factually
08:34 correct both will be under I safeguards
08:37 the technology and the nuclear material
08:39 is not the same but Saudi Arabia has
08:42 said on the record that if Iran develops
08:45 nuclear weapons it will also develop
08:47 nuclear weapons but Saudi Arabia would
08:50 have a long way to go it has no nuclear
08:53 material it has no nuclear expertise
08:55 couldn't it just buy couldn't it buy
08:57 some nuclear weapons on the black market
08:59 no there are no nuclear weapons on the
09:00 black market sorry to say this is just
09:02 wrong information yes someone guy Robert
09:05 said that it is possible I seem to
09:07 recall and um that was maybe after I
09:10 finished taking so I would recommend to
09:12 your students to read this article by
09:14 benoa pelop Pedas p l o p i d a s okay
09:20 called the Oracles of proliferation okay
09:24 and this is a very good yeah he's a
09:26 professor nuclear history professor at
09:28 sanpo okay in Paris he has written a
09:32 very good article on how The Narrative
09:34 of proliferation has been developed yes
09:36 of castigating some states and
09:38 whitewashing the actions of other states
09:41 so today we have nine countries with
09:43 nuclear
09:44 weapons none of these nine countries
09:47 nuclear weapons program was truly
09:50 indigenous all nine countries have
09:52 received and are given help to another
09:55 country build nuclear weapons including
09:56 the Manhattan Project yeah Canada helped
09:59 out there SCH gave a but you know all
10:01 the major discoveries in nuclear were
10:03 done in Europe yeah yep but I think
10:07 that's what people are worried about is
10:08 an aqan figure teaching because the
10:12 nuclear Genie is out of the bottle
10:13 teaching more and more countries
10:15 including terrorist organizations to
10:18 somehow build a dirty bomb I'm not so
10:20 worried about that because it's a
10:22 smaller dirty bomb and I think they
10:24 would be caught I'm not I am not worried
10:27 about yeah I think ER that is also false
10:30 narrative that was developed some years
10:32 ago
10:34 uh actually it's not that difficult for
10:36 a country to make a nuclear weapon if
10:39 they have the nuclear material and at
10:41 the moment except for Iran where its
10:44 program thus far is under safeg guards
10:46 Iran has not threatened officially to
10:48 leave the non-proliferation treaty
10:50 though individuals have threatened to do
10:52 so so on Monday and Tuesday uh the
10:56 British the French and the Germans met
10:58 with Iran in
11:00 to restart a discussion so that they
11:03 could invite the Trump Administration to
11:05 join it because they're very worried
11:07 that the Trump Administration after
11:09 January 20 might fall into the Trap of
11:13 prime minister Netanyahu to launch an
11:15 attack on Iran's nuclear facilities even
11:18 the head of the CIA has said there is no
11:20 indication that Iran has taken the
11:22 decision to build a nuclear weapon and
11:25 also and a military attack will not
11:28 eliminate Iran's new nuclear expertise
11:31 or nuclear potential they will be able
11:32 to reconstitute in two years and go
11:35 ahead and build a nuclear weapon so we
11:37 don't we need not to be emotional about
11:40 this unfortunately in today's hyper
11:42 media world we have to be careful this
11:44 is the public recording in that there
11:46 are like thousands of students in the
11:49 class and so I cannot control where the
11:51 video goes so if you don't mind I would
11:53 like to move away from speaking about a
11:56 possible attack by Israel on Iran's
11:58 nuclear facilities um
12:01 although the osara reactor is part of
12:03 history and also Israel has attacked
12:05 with pagers and radios and and so on
12:09 there's been different attacks but I
12:10 have to be very evenhanded here um and
12:14 and rather than dwell on
12:17 um The Narrative regarding Israel and
12:20 Iran I I want to um talk a little bit
12:22 more about the finger the president
12:25 Trump's finger on the nuclear trigger
12:27 are you concerned that President Trump
12:29 because of some of his irrational
12:31 statements let's say regarding North
12:32 Korea um would be irrational and that
12:35 that would undermine deterence
12:38 deterrence would be undermined because
12:40 it is not evident that he's making clear
12:42 cost benefit rational considerations or
12:46 do you think his irrationality and his
12:49 apparent um kind of anger and vitriol
12:52 and so on that actually but's deterrence
12:54 it makes it
12:56 stronger so in the United States
12:58 starting uh
12:60 with the President Truman I think the
13:03 concept of sole authority to use nuclear
13:06 weapons residing in the president uh was
13:09 established and it continues to this day
13:11 today although the military also has
13:15 said that they have the responsibility
13:17 not to follow an illegal order or an
13:21 order that they feel is coming from a
13:23 president who might be mentally
13:26 Disturbed so there are concerns but I
13:29 don't think we need to Hype that either
13:32 yeah I think so you're feeling confident
13:34 that certainly in the United States but
13:36 what about in Russia or let's wait you
13:39 know I don't think it would be possible
13:41 in China but are you concerned about an
13:44 accidental a launch between the
13:46 Strategic nuclear Powers not so much
13:48 between the wouldbe uh nuclear Powers
13:52 well this is a concern with regard to
13:55 the ongoing war in
13:57 Ukraine it's more likely that it would
13:60 not be a use of central strategic forces
14:04 but more likely a missile with the
14:07 regional range of the type that was
14:10 eliminated under uh the INF treaty now
14:13 Germany is
14:15 clamoring for the United States to bring
14:17 nuclear weapons back to Germany and
14:21 there is also talk of uh US nuclear
14:24 weapons returning to South Korea they
14:26 were withdrawn by the senior President
14:29 Bush in 1991 as a result of presidential
14:32 nuclear initiatives now the Russian
14:35 nuclear doctrine that your previous
14:36 guest was discussing has also been
14:40 misrepresented so I'm not defending
14:42 Russia here what the Russians have said
14:44 is they basically harmonized at one
14:47 level their nuclear weapons employment
14:50 policy with what the United States
14:52 Britain and France have donees so what
14:54 the Russians are saying now which is
14:56 what uh the other nuclear Powers except
14:59 for China which has a no first use
15:01 policy have said in Security Council
15:04 resolutions 255 on positive security
15:06 assurances of
15:08 1968 and resolution 984 of
15:12 1995 that they will not attack a
15:15 nonclear weapon state party to the npt
15:18 except if that non-nuclear weapon state
15:22 in association with another nuclear
15:25 weapon fate attacks me aren't those
15:28 called negative security insurance is
15:29 not positive yeah positive the positive
15:33 would be like Japan or something yeah no
15:35 no no the positive in two in 1968 was
15:38 that if you're attacked with nuclear
15:39 weapons I promise to come to your help
15:42 okay we will call a meeting of the
15:44 security Council and then decide how to
15:46 help yeah and then the negatives are
15:48 negative is but you know the nuclear
15:51 posture review of the Biden
15:54 Administration like that of the Trump
15:56 Administration with with which I think
15:58 your previous guest was involved
16:00 says that they will not attack a
16:02 non-nuclear weapon state in compliance
16:04 with the non-proliferation treaty now
16:07 who decides that the United States have
16:09 has left that decision to itself they
16:13 normally it's the international atomic
16:15 energy agency that reports whether a
16:17 country or not is complying with its
16:20 verification um obligations to use
16:24 nuclear material only for peaceful
16:25 purposes and not make a bomb here the US
16:28 will decide with the country X is in
16:31 compliance with the non-proliferation
16:32 treaty if Washington decides that it is
16:35 not it potentially could be open to a US
16:38 attack and um there was also the
16:41 discussion with Mr Roberts about the
16:43 Russian uh Doctrine about escalating to
16:48 deescalate now the US incorrect but
16:51 that's okay because it was an informal
16:53 discussion and we're not you know this
16:54 that is not that is this wrong this
16:56 translation but it's not totally wrong
16:59 but the US also in its nuclear posture
17:01 review has said that it could use
17:03 nuclear weapons to restore strategic
17:05 stability so the two of them are not
17:08 that far apart so this is the problem
17:10 with nuclear weapon states that you know
17:13 they decide and they keep on changing
17:15 and so we cannot be confident under what
17:18 circumstances they may or may not use
17:20 nuclear weapons and therefore for people
17:23 like you and I who've been fighting the
17:25 struggle for a long time to reduce
17:27 nuclear weapons and eventually to try to
17:29 seek a world without nuclear weapons and
17:32 we should remember that Canada was the
17:34 first country to renounce nuclear
17:36 weapons in the three Nation Declaration
17:38 of December
17:40 1945 where the prime ministers of Canada
17:43 and the UK and the US president met and
17:46 Canada said we contributed to the
17:48 Manhattan Project we do have the
17:50 expertise yeah we had the technology
17:52 everything we had the urani we were the
17:54 only country you know people always say
17:56 oh Kazakhstan and Ukraine made decisions
17:58 to get rid of of the arsenals that were
17:60 on their territory but Canada actually
18:02 had the capability to build its own
18:04 nuclear weapons and decided not to and
18:06 you're a Canadian and you've been a
18:08 longtime stalwart defender of nuclear
18:12 disarmament and nuclear and and nuclear
18:14 abolition and so I brought you on
18:16 because I wanted a counter to guy
18:18 Roberts who was at the you know he's the
18:21 one who who who steered the nuclear
18:24 modernization review and a program he
18:27 was in charge of seven more than 70
18:29 billion dollars of spending and yet when
18:32 I asked him well what about the Russians
18:35 and and modernizing that so that we're
18:37 safer he didn't think about that he was
18:39 thinking more about modernizing I think
18:42 because they want to get into space and
18:44 they want to get involved in a ballistic
18:45 missile defense project and so I think
18:47 underlying all that although it was not
18:49 brought up is the whole race to get into
18:53 space well the Russians have modernized
18:56 as well so the United States is a little
18:58 bit behind so we may not agree with
19:02 their rationale but the US wants to
19:05 replace the landbased intercontinental
19:08 ballistic missiles with the new one they
19:10 want to they need to they say they need
19:14 to make new ballistic missile submarines
19:16 and new
19:17 bombers and uh for that they have
19:19 Congress has authorized production of
19:24 990 plutonium pits per year for new
19:27 nuclear warheads but but in the past 2
19:30 years the national nuclear Security
19:32 Administration has only been able to
19:34 deliver one pit per
19:36 year so
19:38 the US modernization which actually
19:41 started under Obama even though he gave
19:43 the Prague speech is a trillion dollar
19:47 modernization trillion dollars yep great
19:51 article in the New York Times did you
19:52 see that one on the New York Times on
19:53 the modernization which is permeating
19:55 all of us Society every Congressional
19:59 district is involved in the
20:01 modernization but I'm I'm I'm curious
20:03 why you said that Russia has modernized
20:05 because I understood the global
20:06 partnership program was Desperately
20:07 Seeking money to give to Russia so that
20:10 it will modernize no no no this that
20:13 program was directed at to its at
20:16 emergence of Russia in
20:18 1991 to secure Russian nuclear weapons
20:21 so they were provided safe secure
20:24 transport so that the nuclear weapons
20:26 that were withdrawn from bellarus
20:28 Kazakhstan and Ukraine could be
20:30 transported safely back to Russia and
20:33 then there were more than 100 disused
20:37 cores of nulear reactors of nuclear
20:40 powered submarines which were up in the
20:42 Arctic and had had the Arctic being
20:45 poisoned we would be affected as well in
20:47 Canada so the G7 money was used to take
20:50 those reactor cores and the plutonium to
20:53 be taken out at the mayak facility in
20:56 the middle of Russia and that plutonium
20:58 to be
20:59 denatured so several years ago the G7
21:03 Global Partnerships stopped giving money
21:05 to Russia and also Russia said I don't
21:07 need your money anymore so now the money
21:10 is going for other projects in other
21:12 countries although Canada is still
21:15 contributing I think a billion dollars
21:16 it's one of the global Affairs biggest
21:19 projects and um I think uh the spending
21:23 on that is enormous and Canada's quite
21:25 proud of it and because I'm teaching a
21:27 course on can in the world abroad then
21:29 not to Russia that yeah yeah not to
21:32 Russia yeah not they're not giving it
21:34 directly to Russia no I no but it's now
21:36 more towards uh building up capacity on
21:39 chemical and biological weapons defense
21:40 and non-
21:41 proliferation yes yeah um well I'm
21:44 hoping that students in the future will
21:46 be interested in participating and if
21:48 there's any hints that you can give them
21:50 in the last few minutes on how to forge
21:52 a diplomatic career I met you back in
21:55 1987 when I brought a group of 10
21:57 students from the University of Toronto
21:59 up to Ottawa and you kindly granted us
22:02 um 20 minutes and we were extreme that
22:04 was that was 30 God knows how long ago
22:06 that was when I first met you Tariq and
22:08 since then um I've admired greatly all
22:11 the work that you've done you have a
22:12 gift of uh getting a different diplomats
22:15 together understanding what they're
22:17 agreeing to deleting the words and
22:19 getting them to agree behind the scenes
22:22 did you want to give the students any
22:24 kind of hints about how to forge a
22:26 career in diplomacy
22:29 um yes a is to work hard yeah to develop
22:33 some specific
22:35 expertise um one one career path is to
22:39 join either the department of Foreign
22:41 Affairs uh Department of National
22:43 Defense also is supposed to have an arms
22:45 control yeah component you would know
22:48 more about that but there are also
22:50 International organizations like the UN
22:52 office for dis government affairs with
22:54 head office in New York and branch
22:56 office in Geneva there's International
22:59 atomic energy agency the comprehensive
23:01 nuclear testb Treaty Organization and
23:04 Erica at the Ia there are two specific
23:07 projects basically aimed of bringing
23:10 women in
23:11 nuclear one is the least smer um no Mar
23:16 Mari curri slatka scholarship which is
23:19 for women students engaged in Master's
23:22 programs and those who are selected can
23:25 will also get one year of internship at
23:27 the Ia and then there is the lease smer
23:30 program for women who have already
23:32 graduated and it gives them an
23:34 opportunity for one year's work I've
23:36 never been selected for anything because
23:38 I'm a woman um I've never never not even
23:42 my job it was it was but this is because
23:44 of the I'm always reluctant to advertise
23:47 things that say well because you're a
23:49 woman you get to to to you get yeah but
23:51 you know these are gender uh equality
23:54 programs and um so the Ia has committed
23:58 to have 50 50% staff professionals is
24:01 women and 50% men really so we we've
24:04 progressed from gender balance to gender
24:06 parity to gender equality wow but not
24:09 all countries accept the concept of
24:11 gender equality not at all well gender
24:13 balance can be
24:15 6040 gender parity could also be less
24:17 than
24:18 50/50 so this is not being um
24:22 condescending to women but it's
24:25 basically providing opportunities where
24:27 previously these opportunities were not
24:29 available to women yeah that's but there
24:31 is a backlash where they will say that
24:34 you got there because you're a woman um
24:37 and that's called well you know you can
24:39 can't stop people from talking but also
24:40 you know globally people would like more
24:43 diversity in stem subjects generally men
24:46 go women have stayed away so we need to
24:49 break down those barriers and and not
24:52 get ourselves involved in the politics
24:54 of gender politics because it doesn't
24:55 get us anywhere and so I would rather
24:58 not get into that discussion so it's
25:01 fascinating and it affects so many
25:02 people that are in my class and so um
25:05 you know they're all in in all sorts of
25:07 fields and I think this is a good note
25:08 to end on because when you said work
25:11 hard you have worked extremely hard you
25:13 got a PhD in arms control and you you
25:16 didn't mention that that's an important
25:18 thing is to get further education
25:20 publish a lot and then just stay on top
25:22 of everything all the time you have
25:24 always stayed on top of all every I mean
25:27 it's just unbelievable to to me how much
25:29 you stay on top of everything and I want
25:31 to congratulate you that on next week
25:33 the last time we actually saw each other
25:35 was in ASA um on the bus there uh going
25:40 in Kazakhstan when we were there um
25:42 quite a few years ago but I hope that we
25:44 can see each other again in person
25:46 someday and if you don't mind if a few
25:47 students reach out to you um we'll let
25:50 them reach out to you in person and
